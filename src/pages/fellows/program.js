                    The NHLBI BioData Catalyst Fellows Program provides early-career researchers (graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and others) the opportunity to receive funding to help support research on novel and innovative data science and data-focused research problems. The program is open to academic disciplines conducting biomedical research in heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) domains and may include focus on the impact of SARS-COV-2 in those domains.
                </Paragraph>
        
                <Paragraph>
                    The vision for the BioData Catalyst is to be a community-driven ecosystem implementing data science solutions, democratizing data and computational access, extending services such as TOPMed and dbGaP, and advancing HLBS science. The BioData Catalyst Fellows Program offers a mechanism for early career researchers to engage with the Consortium as partners in the BioData Catalyst endeavor. The BioData Catalyst Consortium seeks projects that represent diversity across fields of study, institutions, geography, and investigators.

                <Paragraph>
                    Preference will be given to proposals that leverage the strengths of the ecosystem to enable cutting edge research and also test the capabilities of the ecosystem. Consideration will be given to early-career applicants (graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and others), especially those who will bring diversity to the BioData Catalyst community.
                </Paragraph>
    
                <Paragraph>
                    The Cohort 3 fellowship funding period will run 12 months, from March 2021 to February 2022, with a brief project report due six months into the project and a final report due at the end. All Fellows will be expected to be involved in NHLBI BioData Catalyst activities during the year, including attending quarterly consortium meetings and participating in monthly Fellows meetings. Fellows will also be encouraged to make their workflows and tools available within the ecosystem and the broader research community and to welcome and help onboard new users to the community.

                <Subheading>Team-Based Proposals</Subheading>
    
                <Paragraph>
                    Team-based proposals (for example a subject matter expert paired with a computational expert) are available for Cohort 3 applications. Team proposals offer an opportunity to fulfill the BioData Catalyst goal of fostering diversity across fields of study, institutions, geography, and investigators. Team members should submit separate applications with the prefix "Team Proposal:". Title, Abstract, Project Aims, and Budget Estimate should be the same for Team proposals.  Team proposals will need to demonstrate the significance and added value of including multiple investigators. Team proposal budgets should clearly indicate the percentage of work to be done by each collaborator and should justify any budget of more than $69, 733 for the project as a whole, up to $100,000.

                <Paragraph>
                    Research proposals that aim to extend our understanding of the effects of SARS-COV-2 in HLBS domains are strongly encouraged. The NHLBI encourages the use of the BioData Catalyst ecosystem to study SARS-COV-2 pathophysiology and understand long-term sequelae as the pandemic continues to evolve. More information on SARS-COV-2 work being done on BioData Catalyst can be found <Link to="/covid-19">here</Link>.

                    Awardees will receive a stipend of up to $69,733, which includes costs for salary, travel, training, publication, and conference fees. As part of the Uniform Guidance, fellowships are not subject to indirect costs, and these should not be budgeted. Reasonable cloud costs will be covered by NHLBI and should not be included in your budget. Fellows are expected to contribute a significant percentage of their time to their project proposals (25% at a minimum for each Fellow).
