                For research investigators who need to find, access, share,
                store, and compute on large scale datasets, NHLBI BioData
                Catalyst serves as a cloud-based ecosystem providing tools,
                applications, and workflows to enable these capabilities in
                secure workspaces.
              </Paragraph>

                Though the primary goal of the BioData Catalyst project is to
                build a data science ecosystem, at its core, this is a
                people-centric endeavor. BioData Catalyst is also building a
                community of practice working to collaboratively solve technical
                and scientific challenges.
