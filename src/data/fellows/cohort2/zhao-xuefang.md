  title: Defining the Impact of Canonical and Complex Structural Variation on Plasma Lipid Levels
  abstract: >
    Canonical structural variants (SV) are a significant component of the genetic architecture of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the role of non-canonical complex structural variation (cxSV) composed of multiple SV signatures is largely unexplored. We recently demonstrated that cxSVs are remarkably abundant in the human germline genome (~37 per person1) and ~10% represent loss-of-function variants. This proposal will leverage large-scale canonical and cxSV discovery on >66,000 genomes with plasma lipid traits from TOPMed. Plasma lipids are significantly correlated with risk for CVD, and further defining the influence of SVs on this trait will improve risk profiling and therapeutic targeting. This fellowship will thus yield a spectrum of canonical and cxSVs in CVD cases that can be utilized for trait association across TOPMed studies.

  Xuefang Zhao holds a Master's degree in Statistics and a PhD in Bioinformatics from the University of Michigan. Her PhD training focuses on developing computational tools to discover and evaluate genomic structural variation (SV), and she developed algorithms to resolve complex SV from short read whole genome sequencing (srWGS) and to evaluate SV with long read WGS (lrWGS). During postdoctoral training, she extended her research to develop cloud-based methods, and helped implement GATK-SV, an ensemble algorithm that enables comprehensive SV discovery from population-scale studies, on Google Cloud. She applied this tool to define and interpret SVs in pathogenic cohorts.
