  title: Building resources for identifying and analyzing CHIP
  abstract: >
    Somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, termed “Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP)”, are present in >10% of adults over 70 and are associated with adverse health consequences across hematologic, cardiovascular and pulmonary domains. However, no standard tool exists to identify samples with CHIP. I propose to build new cloud-based community resources for identifying and analyzing CHIP which can be leveraged by the BDC community. Second, I will develop a novel method estimating clonal expansion rate from a single sequenced sample. I will leverage this method to discover genetic and environmental risk factors of CHIP clonal expansion and its effects on cardiovascular disease.
bio: Alexander Bick is a physician-scientist working in the field of human genomics. He is an Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University in the Division of Genetic Medicine. His scientific observations have advanced our understanding of the genetic basis for cardiovascular disease, characterized molecular disease mechanisms, and identified both the promise and limitations of translating genomic findings into routine medical practice. Dr. Bick's current scientific focus is on clonal hematopoiesis, a unifying feature of aging diseases as diverse as cardiovascular disease and cancer. He seeks to understand how the interplay between inherited germline genetic factors and acquired somatic mutations contributes to disease.
