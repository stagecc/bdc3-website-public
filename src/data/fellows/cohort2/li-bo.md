  title: Detailed characterization of the 1.5-million-cell human Immune Cell Atlas single-cell RNA-seq data provides a valuable healthy reference for COVID-19 research
  abstract: >
    I propose to characterize all mononuclear cell types and cell states in hematopoiesis by analyzing the 1.5-million-cell human Immune Cell Atlas (bone marrow, peripheral blood and cord blood) single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset we have generated using Cumulus and the Terra platform. To demonstrate the value of our dataset for COVID-19 research, I further propose to identify rare cell populations from a public peripheral blood scRNA-seq dataset of COVID-19 patients (28,094 cells) by utilizing our Immune Cell Atlas as a healthy reference. In addition, collaborating with the Terra team, I will create a featured Terra workspace reproducing the proposed analysis and develop a workshop for BDC users based on the featured workspace, demonstrating the best practices for large-scale scRNA-seq analysis using the BDC ecosystem.
bio: Bo Li is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Director of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the Center for Immunology Inflammatory Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital. His research focuses on large-scale single-cell genomics data analysis. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and completed two postdoctoral trainings with Dr. Lior Pachter at the University of California, Berkeley and Dr. Aviv Regev at the Broad Institute. He is best known for developing RSEM, an impactful RNA-seq transcript quantification software. RSEM is cited 8,713 times (Google Scholar) and adopted by several big consortia such as TCGA, ENCODE, GTEx and TOPMed.
