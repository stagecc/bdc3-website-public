  title: Cloud-based Infrastructure for Integration and Analysis of Polysomnography Data Supporting Translational Sleep Medicine
  abstract: >
    Sleep disorders are highly prevalent conditions, affecting the health and well-being of millions of individuals. Despite efforts in recognizing sleep problems as modifiable risk factors for life-debilitating conditions, clinical translation of studies suggesting that sleep interventions might improve health-related outcomes is insufficient. Major limiting factors impeding large-scale implementation include non-conventional data types, lack of uniform metadata, and absence of standardized analytical pipelines. In this NHLBI Fellows Program, I will leverage the BDC ecosystem and implement common polysomnography analytical workflows applied to existing and new datasets funded by the NHLBI in this domain. My goal is to facilitate the implementation of novel sleep biomarkers and support an open-source, community-driven platform for rapid translation of sleep research findings into clinical care.
bio: Diego Mazzotti is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Medical Informatics, Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Dr. Mazzotti received his PhD in Psychobiology at the Federal University of Sao Paulo, Brazil and a Certificate in Biomedical Informatics from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. His current research focuses on the analysis of high-dimensional sleep data to understand how they can be translated into clinical knowledge and applications that can advance healthcare. Dr. Mazzotti aims to establish a solid multidisciplinary research program in the interface between Biomedical Informatics and Sleep Medicine.
