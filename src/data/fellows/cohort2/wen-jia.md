  title: Discovery of modifier loci of lung disease severity in cystic fibrosis (CF) by CF-tailored genotype imputation and scanning of candidate regulatory regions
  abstract: >
    I will use the BioData Catalyst platform to conduct imputation using whole-genome sequencing data (WGS) generated by the Cystic Fibrosis Genome Project. Imputation into cystic fibrosis (CF) patients using WGS data from other CF patients as reference (internal reference) will likely better rescue regions most relevant to CF (e.g., the CF causing gene CFTR and CF modifier genes such as MUC4, SLC9A3), where existing reference panels have had poor performance. We will assess imputation quality using internal and the state-of-the-art reference panels. Furthermore, we will scan candidate regulatory regions based on annotations from WGS Annotator (WGSA) and from relevant chromatin conformation data to identify regions associated with lung function among CF patients.

  Jia Wen is a statistical geneticist focused on the development of statistical methods and their application to genetic dissection of complex diseases and traits. She is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Genetics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. During her PhD study and post-doc training, she developed computational pipelines and statistical methods to improve computing and statistical efficiency in biomedical research, and conducted statistical, genetic, and bioinformatics analysis to advance genetic understanding for human diseases and traits. Her current projects aim to develop statistical methods for analyzing chromosome conformation capture data and genetic association studies in diverse-ancestry cohorts.
