  title: A novel approach for matching whole genome sequencing data as population controls for new genome wide association studies
  abstract: >
    This project will develop a novel approach to automatically identify population controls from TOPMed data to match with case-only cohorts, allowing users to conduct new genome-wide association studies. The approach will be available as a workflow within BioData Catalyst (BDC), enabling users to use their own cohorts to identify population controls. The BDC ecosystem has existing resources which will be leveraged in this project. The proposed approach, in collaboration with BDC consortium members, will utilize these resources, including searching datasets, harmonizing clinical variables across TOPMed and user-provided array genotyped studies, and running quality control, imputation and GWAS analyses. Throughout the development process, feedback, including bugs, user experience suggestions, and features for development (e.g., harmonization and implementation approaches) will be communicated to the BDC consortium members.

  Ravi Mathur is a statistical geneticist in RTI International's GenOmics, Bioinformatics, and Translational Research Center. He received a PhD from the Bioinformatics Research Center at North Carolina State University. He has broad experience in genetics, statistical programming, cloud computing, and data integration. He has successfully conducted and published studies utilizing large-scale omic data including whole genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphisms. These studies have used various statistical approaches including linear mixed modeling, machine learning, and integration with multi-omic methods. His research interests include techniques for integrating multiple omic technologies, and building tools, pipelines, and workflows that make omic discovery more efficient.
