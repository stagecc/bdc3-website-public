  title: Transcriptome-wide association study of heart failure in diabetes
  abstract: >
    Heart failure (HF) is more frequent and has worse outcomes among people with diabetes mellitus (DM). The goal of this study is to utilize the BDC ecosystem to dissect the genes and molecular pathways involved in HF etiology in the diabetic as compared to the non-diabetic population. Under the joint supervision of Drs. Doria (Havard) and Mychaleckyj (UVA), I will conduct a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of HF among individuals with or without DM, leveraging the whole genome sequencing (WGS) and precise HF phenotype data from TOPMed along with the transcriptome data from GTEx. Not only will this project identify diabetes-specific gene expression signatures of HF, but will also provide a pipeline for TWAS of other complex traits in the BDC environment.

  Yaling Tang's research focuses on the epidemiology and genetics of variability in the clinical presentation of diabetes and its complications, with the goal of understanding the underlying mechanisms and finding new ways to prevent these disorders. After completing her M.D. (Xiangya Medical School) and residency (Peking Union Medical Hospital) in China, she joined Dr. Alessandro Doria's group at the Joslin Diabetes Center as a graduate student in the MMSc of Clinical Investigation program at Harvard Medical School. She is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in Dr. Doria's lab, where she is analyzing clinical and genetic data from large-scale population studies.
