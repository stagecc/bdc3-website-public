    title: Genetic and biomarker prediction of cardiopulmonary dysfunction and rates of hemolysis in sickle cell disease
    abstract: >
        The multifaceted complications in sickle cell disease (SCD) significantly affect quality of life and life expectancy. Cardiopulmonary dysfunction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SCD. Our recent studies demonstrated association of cardiopulmonary dysfunction with elevated hemolysis. This proposal aims to identify genetic predictors of cardiopulmonary outcomes of SCD and to assess the mediating effect of hemolysis. The project involves phenotype harmonization, genetic association and mediation analyses through which detailed feedback on BioData Catalyst can be provided and the experience of the ecosystem functionality can be shared with peers in the SCD working group.

    Xu Zhang obtained her PhD from the department of Botany and Agricultural Biochemistry at the University of Vermont. Dr. Zhang had her postdoctoral training from 2004 - 2009 in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. In 2012 he joined the Sickle Cell Disease Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago as an Assistant Professor. Her research is focused on quantitative genetics and genomics approaches to study complex traits. She is currently working on the genetic basis of clinical variations in sickle cell disease.
