    title: Examining the Role of Racial Discrimination Related Psychosocial Stress in Subclinical Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and Incident CVD Cases from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)
    abstract: >
        The proposed study will examine allostatic load and telomere length as mediators between psychosocial stress related to racial discrimination and CVD incidence among African-Americans. It is critical to incorporate biomarker data into statistical analyses to better understand disparities in subclinical CVD and CVD events. This fellowship will enable me to engage in the bi-directional exchange of ideas and methods with other investigators. In particular, this fellowship will afford me with a unique opportunity to evaluate statistical modeling approaches and interim results with other scholars in the program and maximize the project’s potential contribution to the field. Through this fellowship, I will be part of an intellectual support system that will span my research career and enhance both my work and the work of my cohort.
