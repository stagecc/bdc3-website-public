  title: Apply and evaluate an instance-specific causal machine learning framework for identifying the causative genomic variants of cardiovascular diseases
  abstract: >
    Previous efforts in identifying genomic variants in cardiovascular diseases were mostly population-based association studies. I propose to implement and evaluate an instance-specific causal inference (ICI) framework, which is capable of discovering causative genomic variants in a given instance (e.g., a patient). As such, ICI addresses a fundamental problem in precision medicine: determining which genomic variants are causally responsible for the phenotypes observed in a specific patient. Moreover, concentrating on the genomic variants observed in a given individual, ICI has the potential to discover the causative variants of low frequency. Thus, the ICI framework has a significant potential to derive rich information from TOPMed data that is useful to the HLBS community.

  Jinling Liu is an Assistant Professor at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. After graduating with a PhD degree in Biology from Penn State University, she obtained a National Library of Medicine Postdoctoral Fellowship as well as an MS degree in Biomedical Informatics from the University of Pittsburgh. She has extensive experience in molecular biology, immunology, multi-omics analytics, probabilistic graphical models and causal machine learning techniques. With unique expertise in both biology and informatics, her goal is to infer the activation states of signaling pathways from the multi-omics data and utilize it in precision medicine.
