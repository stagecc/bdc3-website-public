  title: Deep Learning on Graphs for Multi-omics Classification of COPD
  abstract: >
    To further elucidate molecular mechanisms of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), we need to consider the innate relational and cooperative characteristic of genes, proteins, and other molecules. In this proposed study, we will incorporate prior protein/genetic interaction information with co-expression data and build a more specific network associated with COPD. We will integrate the resultant network with omics data to improve accuracy for COPD classification. To accelerate research, the model(s) will be developed in the powerful BDC ecosystem. While working on this project, I will provide feedback to help improve this ecosystem, continuing my involvement as a power user for DataSTAGE to test new tools. This project also addresses the goals of the Fellows Program since it is focused on the TOPMed Cohort COPDGene.

  Yonghua Zhuang is a PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. He received a PhD in Immunology from Sichuan University. His current research focuses on disease classification from omics profiles using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks by integrating protein-protein interaction network information and co-expression data. His long-term research interest is the development of statistical methods for analyzing high-throughput omic data to better understand how key interactions between genes (or proteins) contribute to human diseases. His academic training and research experience have provided him with a strong integrated background in biostatistics, machine learning, and biology.
