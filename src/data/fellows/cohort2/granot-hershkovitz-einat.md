  title: Identification of ancestry-enriched genetic variants in the U.S. Latino/Hispanic population modifying the effect of APOE alleles on neurocognitive and cardiovascular risk traits
  abstract: >
    Hispanics are an understudied admixed-population with three predominant continental genetic ancestries: Amerindian, African, and European. This population suffers from health disparities such as relatively high rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease. I propose to utilize the BioData Catalyst platform to access several TOPMed studies consisting of Hispanic individuals to identify enriched Amerindian- and African-specific genetic variants. Next, I will study the enriched-variants interaction with the well-known APOEŒμ4 genetic risk factor for AD and cardiovascular disease, primarily in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). The APOEŒμ4-AD association shows heterogeneity in non-European ancestry groups, with weaker and inconsistent associations observed in Hispanics. I hypothesize that ancestry enriched- ancestry genetic factors interact with the APOE alleles in their associations with AD and cardiovascular disease.

  Einat Granot-Hershkovitz is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Program of Sleep Medicine Epidemiology in Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School, working with Dr. Tamar Sofer. Einat is focusing on genetics and omics components underlying neurocognitive aging, primarily in the Hispanic/Latino understudied population. Her work exploits the unique admixed genetic architecture of this population to identify enriched-ancestry genetic variants and their effects on neurocognitive aging. She has received her PhD in Genetic Epidemiology and MSc in Human Genetics and Genetic Counseling from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
