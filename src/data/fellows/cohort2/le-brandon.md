  title: Modeling Sickle Cell Disease phenotypes through supervised learning of patient multi-omic data
  abstract: >
    Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder in which some clinical complications, such as renal dysfunction, are associated with early mortality. Not all SCD patients develop significant renal dysfunction, suggesting that factors beyond the primary beta globin mutation impact risk. Our lab recently discovered novel genetic variants contributing to SCD renal outcomes and, through incorporation of other omics data, improved interpretation of the pathophysiology of the loci. Using machine learning methods, I propose to develop inferential models that 1) impute missing omics data within patients’ omics profiles, and 2) predict omic variability associated with renal outcomes. The predictive models generated will inform future studies through combining machine learning tools with multi-omics data, as well as illuminate important SCD pathophysiology.
bio: Brandon Lê is a Graduate Research Assistant working with Dr. Allison Ashley-Koch at the Duke Molecular Physiology Institute at Duke University. He is currently pursuing a PhD in genetics and genomics, and his current research interests revolve around investigating the genetic and omic modifiers of sickle cell disease. His prior research was conducted at the Marine Biological Laboratory, focused on the diversity and propagation of transposable elements in parasitoid genomes. He received his undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Brown University.
