    title: Elucidating the genetic risk of heritable cardiomyopathies through variant co-occurrence analysis
    abstract: >
        Heritable cardiomyopathies affect 1 in 200 to 500 individuals in the U.S., many of whom are symptom-free yet at risk of heart failure and sudden death (Hershberger, Hedges, and Morales 2013a). Genetic testing is helping to identify at-risk individuals, yet is limited by Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS): genetic variants of unclear clinical impact. A powerful approach to interpreting VUS is analyzing variant co-occurrences: observing a VUS in the same subject as a pathogenic variant can support a benign classification. We will develop methods to mine co-occurrences from TOPMed, integrating the results with ClinGen, while ensuring TOPMed genotyping accuracy.

    Melissa Cline is a computational biologist specializing in clinical genomics. Her goals are to generate and analyze evidence to determine which genetic variants increase the risk of disease.  She is the program manager of the BRCA Challenge, a consortium launched by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to expand data sharing for genetic research, with a focus on the BRCA genes in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer as an exemplar for other genes and heritable disorders. She is active in several GA4GH workstreams, and the HGVS society. Outside of work, she patrols with the Tahoe Backcountry Ski Patrol.
