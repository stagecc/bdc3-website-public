    title: Computational Methods for Detection of Unseen Pathologies with Deep Learning Algorithms for Chest X-ray Interpretation
    abstract: >
        Chest radiography, the most common imaging procedure, is critical for the diagnosis and management of disease. Recent advances in training deep learning algorithms using large datasets have demonstrated the potential of accurate automated chest radiograph interpretation. However, most chest X-ray algorithms are trained to detect a handful of pathologies, while the successful deployment of algorithms requires them to understand the presence of pathologies beyond those they are trained to detect (unseen pathologies). In this study, I will develop innovative tools to both examine and improve the performance of chest x-ray algorithms in the detection of unseen pathologies. My methods will leverage the BioData Catalyst environment for running cloud-based workflows on large X-ray datasets, and the tools will be incorporated into the BioData Catalyst ecosystem.

    Pranav Rajpurkar is a PhD candidate in the Stanford Machine Learning Group co-advised by Drs. Andrew Ng and Percy Liang. His research interest is in building artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to tackle real world problems in medicine. His PhD work has led to the development of AI technologies for clinical medicine (CheXNet), and large datasets that have facilitated advancements of AI technologies in both medicine (CheXpert) and natural language processing systems (SQuAD). His long-term mission is to build AI technologies that will be used routinely for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients. Pranav received both his Bachelors and Masters Degrees in Computer Science from Stanford University. His research has been published in both medical journals (Nature Medicine, PLOS Medicine) and computer science conferences (ACL, EMNLP, AAAI), and covered by media outlets including NPR, the Washington Post, and WIRED. He designed the AI for Healthcare Bootcamp at Stanford, where he has mentored Stanford students on AI for Healthcare research projects. With Eric Topol, he writes Doctor Penguin, a weekly newsletter highlighting AI for Medicine research.
