  title: Prediction and characterization of genetically regulated expression of target tissues in asthma
  abstract: >
    Identification of expression signatures associated with asthma in target tissues can give new insight into the genetics driving dysfunction in allergic disease. In this study, I will build and apply predictive models to estimate genetically driven gene expression in CD4+ T cells and nasal airway epithelium (NAE), and test and replicate associations between estimated gene expression and asthma. Integration of TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data with private gene expression and genotyping data from two populations of African ancestry will capitalize on the ecosystemâ€™s capability to combine public and private datasets. I will develop standardized analytical pipelines for implementation of gene expression prediction and association testing in the ecosystem, and collaborate with my peers developing similarly reusable workflows for the broader scientific community.

  Randi Johnson is an epidemiologist who is passionate about applying her strong quantitative and inter-personal skills to improve population health. Her research leverages multi-omics data to elucidate factors contributing to immune and autoimmune disease development and progression, specifically studying asthma in her postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Kathleen Barnes at the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine. Prior to completing her MPH and PhD in Epidemiology at the Colorado School of Public Health, Dr. Johnson worked as an educator and community health professional. Most days you can find her outside, soaking up the sun and beautiful mountain views.
