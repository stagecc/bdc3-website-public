    title: Genetic Architecture and Contribution of Rare Mutations to Atrial Fibrillation Risk
    abstract: >
        In this application, my goal will be to use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the TOPMed program to 1) analyze rare variants associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and 2) estimate AF-heritability. During my training, I developed expertise in handling large-scale data sets and recently published two papers using sequencing data. I have completed the on-boarding program and will continue collaborating with the Terra (BioData Catalyst platform) team. As a superuser of Terra, I will give feedback to the developers, develop analytic pipelines, and serve as a consultative resource for other users in our working group.

    Seung Hoan Choi is a postdoctoral associate in the laboratory of Dr. Patrick Ellinor in the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative at the Broad Institute. He received a PhD from the Department of Biostatistics at Boston University with his focused research in statistical genetics. His long-term interests are developing and applying novel statistical methods to elucidate the genetic basis of complex diseases. He has been working on developing his analytic capabilities in genetics, statistics, and large-scale data processing. During his postdoctoral training, he has used this foundation to elucidate the genetic basis of a common and complex human disease, atrial fibrillation.
