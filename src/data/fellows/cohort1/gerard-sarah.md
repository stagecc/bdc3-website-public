  title: Ventilation Prediction from Pulmonary CT Using Deep Learning
  abstract: >
    Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating disease that dramatically reduces quality of life and burdens the healthcare system. Early diagnosis is crucial for preventing disease progression. Computed tomography produces high-resolution images of the lungs and has demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity to early disease by revealing subtype-specific structural alterations. In this work we will employ novel artificial intelligence techniques, which thrive on big datasets like COPDGene, to discover image-based phenotypes of COPD. Extensive use of BioData Catalyst in this project will produce user expertise of the system, and in return this will facilitate constructive feedback for improvement.
bio: Sarah Gerard received a PhD in biomedical engineering from the University of Iowa and is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Advanced Pulmonary Physiomic Imaging Laboratory at the University of Iowa. Her primary research focus is developing novel artificial intelligence tools for analysis of computed tomography images to characterize structural and functional phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Gerard is an avid runner, bicyclist, and hiker with her dogs Betty and Wilma.
