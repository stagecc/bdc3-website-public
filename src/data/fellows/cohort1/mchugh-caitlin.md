  title: "A Mixed Model Approach to Testing Multiple Correlated Traits in Large Samples: An Application to the TOPMed Hematology Phenotypes"
  abstract: >
    Large scale consortia amass numerous phenotypes, many of which are correlated. Compared to testing phenotypes independently, testing correlated phenotypes for association simultaneously yields higher power and the ability to identify pleiotropy. Additionally, genetic studies with numerous participants contain population structure and relatedness. Thus, we need efficient models to test multiple, correlated phenotypes while accurately modeling sample structure. I propose to implement the multivariate mixed model in the GENESIS software and create a Seven Bridges workflow for BDC. I will display its utility by applying it to two platelet, seven red blood cell and six white blood cell TOPMed traits.

  With undergraduate training in mathematics and computer science, Caitlin McHugh found her passion in biostatistics where mathematics and statistics are driven by questions whose answers might impact our world someday. McHughâ€™s PhD focused on developing statistical methods for disease association testing among samples with structure such as familial relatedness or population structure, valid for the autosomes and the X chromosome. Residing in NYC, she is currently a research scientist at the Genetic Analysis Center in the Biostatistics Department at the University of Washington, working on methods for large-scale population-based studies such as TOPMed. In her spare time, she loves to knit.
