  title: Genetic Assessment of Sixteen Inflammation Traits in TOPMed Whole Genome Sequencing Data
  abstract: >
    I will use the BDC ecosystem to explore the genetic underpinnings of 16 inflammation biomarkers. Previous inflammation working group analyses did not take advantage of the full sample size now available in TOPMed, thoroughly examine gene and region-based tests, or account for heterogeneous variance across cohorts, issues addressed here. Effects of identified variants on proteomic, metabolomic, transcriptomic, or epigenetic intermediaries will also be examined using pilot data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). My extensive involvement in multiple TOPMed working groups and previous TOPMed publications position me to aid others with the use of the BDC ecosystem.
bio: Laura Raffield is a genetic epidemiologist focused on analysis of inflammation, hematology and hemostasis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes related traits, particularly in underrepresented African American and Hispanic/Latino populations. She is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Genetics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Raffield earned her PhD in Molecular Genetics and Genomics from Wake Forest University School of Medicine and her BS in Biology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
