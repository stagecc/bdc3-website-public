  title: Whole Genome-Sequencing Analyses of Imaging Phenotypes of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
  abstract: >
    COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease caused by a combination of small airway loss and remodeling, and emphysema-induced loss of elastic recoil. While spirometry measures overall airflow limitation, phenotypes from CT imaging provide information about the distribution and severity of pathologic processes leading to COPD. In this project, I propose to conduct whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses on existing and newly generated imaging phenotypes related to COPD on the BDC ecosystem. I hypothesize that there are distinct genetic variants associated with different imaging phenotypes of COPD, and I propose to leverage BDC and the Chest Imaging Platform (CIP on BDC) to enable more rapid testing and closer interaction between generation of imaging features and genetic analysis.
bio: Dandi Qiao is currently an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Channing Division of Network Medicine in the Harvard Medical School and a genetic epidemiologist at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Qiao received her Bachelor of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo and her PhD from the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Her research interest is in the development and application of statistical methods to health-related questions, with a focus in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Dr. Qiao’s recent research topic is developing statistical tools for next generation sequencing data and applying them to identify genetic variants associated with disease susceptibility.
