  title: Scalable Statistical and Computational Methods for Integrating Functional Data in Rare Variant Analysis of Large Whole Genome Sequencing Data
  abstract: >
    Whole genome sequencing studies enable the analysis of rare variants, but conventional rare variant (RV) association tests limit the incorporation of variant function. In this project, I will implement the recently proposed STAAR (variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation) method, an RV association method that effectively incorporates multi-dimensional functional annotations to empower RV analysis, in the BDC ecosystem. I will leverage BDC to develop a scalable workflow that is accessible to the research community on the Terra platform. I will apply the workflow to identify RVs associated with pulmonary function and glycemic traits in collaboration with TOPMed working groups.
bio: Sheila Gaynor is  a postdoctoral research fellow in the Biostatistics department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, working with Dr. Xihong Lin. Her research focuses on integrative statistical genetic and genomics, network analysis, high performance computing, and computational biology. Gaynor is highly engaged in the TOPMed program, where she is leading analyses on rare variants and functional characterization of trait-associated variants. She completed her PhD in Biostatistics at Harvard University in 2018 with a focus on methods in computational biology and multi-omics.
