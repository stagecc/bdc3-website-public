  title: HLA and Genome-Wide Association Studies of Total Serum IgE Levels
  abstract: >
    Total serum IgE (tIgE) is elevated in individuals suffering from allergic diseases such as asthma, rhinitis and eczema, and elevated tIgE has also been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) associations identified for elevated tIgE, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus is the most consistently associated. In this study, I propose HLA and genome-wide association studies of this important intermediary phenotype of disease on BDC. I will develop and support the development of standardized analysis pipelines for potential re-use by other members in my peer group and the wider research community.
bio: Michelle Daya is a human genetics researcher, and her ambition is to use her computational and data analysis skills to improve health outcomes. For her BSc degree, her main subjects were computer science and applied mathematics. After working as a software developer for a number of years, Daya decided to pursue the fascinating field of genetic research, and she obtained her PhD in Human Genetics in May 2015 from Stellenbosch University. Currently, Daya is an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, and her research focuses on using genomics to better understand genetic risk for allergic disease.
