    title: Genotyping Structural Variants in TOPMed Using Pangenome Graphs
    abstract: >
        Structural variants (SVs) have been associated with diseases and often have a larger impact than smaller variants. Still, they remain under-studied in large genomics projects like TOPMed partly due to the limited quality of genotype predictions. By providing variant-aware read mapping and variant calling, we recently demonstrated that variation graphs, implemented in vg, can produce high-quality genotypes from short reads. In this work, I will integrate our existing SV genotyping workflow into the BioData Catalyst ecosystem, run it on 4,000 samples from diverse ethnic backgrounds sequenced in the TOPMed dataset, and investigate associations with type 2 diabetes-relevant phenotypes.
bio: After studying mathematics and physics in preparation for the Concours des Grandes Ecoles and earning an engineering diploma in bioinformatics from the ENSIMAG (Grenoble, France), Jean Monlong spent two years in Barcelona as an exchange student. During this time, he looked for splicing-QTLs in Dr. Roderic Guigo's group at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain. Monlong then completed his PhD with Dr. Guillaume Bourque at McGill University (Montreal, Canada) where he studied copy-number variation in large human cohorts. He is now a postdoctoral researcher in the University of California, Santa Cruz working on variation graph and structural variation in the lab of Dr. Benedict Paten.
