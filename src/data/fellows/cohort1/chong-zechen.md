  title: Contribution of Structural Variations to Cardiovascular Diseases on the BDC Ecosystem
  abstract: >
    There is a fundamental gap in understanding how structural variations contribute to Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) with complex traits. There is an urgent need to fill this gap in knowledge. Without having it, SVs may be omitted as potential targets for precision cardiovascular medicine. The goals of the proposal are to systematically and comprehensively characterize SVs and their contribution to the phenotypes in TOPMed GOLDN and HyperGEN projects, which involve more than 3,000 CVD patients and have multiple data types. By taking advantage of the BDC ecosystem, we expect to establish the association between SVs and CVDs.
bio: Zechen Chong is a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics and Informatics Institute of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). He has been working in the field of Bioinformatics/Genomics for more than a decade and has accumulated extensive experience in genetics, genomics, epigenomics, molecular evolution and population genetics. Chongâ€™s research focuses on developing novel algorithms applied to sequencing data and applying innovative computational approaches to solving hypothesis-driven biological questions. In particular, his group is focusing on characterization, mechanisms, and clinical impact of structural variations.
