  title: Association Study of Iron Overload in Sickle Cell Disease Population Using NHLBI WGS from TOPMed
  abstract: >
    I hypothesize that genetic variation modifies the risk for iron overload in sickle cell patients (SCD) and will seek to validate previously identified mutation and identify novel genetic markers of iron overload. I will identify rare variants in the whole genome sequencing data that are associated with iron overload by performing whole genome sequencing (WGS) association analyses in the Howard PUSH SCD, REDS-III Brazil SCD, OMG SCD, and Walk PHaSST SCD studies which are supported by the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
bio: Fayuan Wen has over 10 years of research experience in cellular and molecular biology with a specific training and expertise in bioinformatics data analysis for next-generation sequencing (NGS) including RNA-seq and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). During her PhD study and post-doc training, she developed the methodology and performed bioinformatics analysis of the proposed research in different areas, including whole genome sequencing analysis of sickle cell disease and host and virus interaction and cells’ transcriptional response to chemical treatment. Wen’s current research focuses on identifying novel genetic markers of iron overload in sickle cell disease patients in the TOPMed WGS project.
