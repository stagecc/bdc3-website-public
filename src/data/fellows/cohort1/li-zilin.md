  title: A Powerful and Resource-Efficient Rare Variant Meta-Analysis Workflow for Large-Scale Multi-Ethnic Sequencing Association Studies Using Summary Statistics and Functional Annotations
  abstract: >
    I propose to develop a powerful and resource-efficient rare variant (RV) meta-analysis cloud-based workflow using summary statistics on <em>BDC Powered by Terra (BDC-Terra)</em>. The proposed workflow is computationally scalable while accounting for population structure and relatedness for continuous and dichotomous traits. It empowers RV association analyses by dynamically incorporating multiple functional annotations and multi-ethnic information. In collaboration with several TOPMed working groups (WGs), including the Lipids WG, I will generate shareable RV summary statistics and perform meta-analysis of TOPMed and UK Biobank data. I will provide training in use of the workflow to consortium members and the broader community.
bio: Zilin Li is currently working on developing statistical and computational methods for analysis of massive Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) studies and applying them to analyze two high profile large-scale NIH whole genome sequencing studies, the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program and the NHLBI Trans-omics Precision Medicine Program. Li is currently working as a research associate in the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. School of Public Health.
