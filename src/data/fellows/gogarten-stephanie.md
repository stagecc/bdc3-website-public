    title: Leveraging Population Diversity in TOPMed for Maximum Analytical Power and Efficient Use of Computational Resources
    abstract: >
        Scientists are working to adapt GWAS methods from SNP arrays to WGS. Often, participants are divided into population groups and analyzed separately. With WGS it is unclear if this approach is beneficial, and potential downsides include wasted computational resources, loss of power (many subjects cannot be assigned to discrete groups), and the social stigma of associating disease outcomes with racial/ethnic groups. I will use BioData Catalyst to compare the results of pooled and stratified GWAS on multiple TOPMed phenotypes, providing feedback to developers and sharing what I learn about the platform and the most efficient analysis methods with other researchers.
bio: Stephanie Gogarten’s educational background is in astrophysics, but while completing her PhD, she discovered a true passion in developing scientific software and grappling with the complexities of massive datasets. For the past 10 years she has been a member of the Genetic Analysis Center housed in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington, developing R/Bioconductor packages and python-based pipelines focused on phenotype-genotype association testing, initially for SNP arrays and then moving into whole genome sequencing. Her team is currently the Data Coordinating Center for TOPMed.
