    title: Characterizing the Impact of Genetic Variation on Cardiometabolic Traits in Ethnically Diverse African Populations
    abstract: >
        My project will combine the TOPMed Africa6K project cohort with other TOPMed cohorts. The analyses and merging of such a large dataset will help demonstrate the capabilities of the BioData Catalyst platform. Since disease causing variants can be targets of natural selection, I will identify cardiometabolic pathways under selection. I will also increase the reproducibility of my research by using the available GWAS apps to find variants associated with cardiometabolic phenotypes. I will generate publicly available workflows for several population genetics programs that are not on the platform. My proposal will have important medical research advancements because African ancestry individuals have increased incidence of cardiometabolic disease and are underrepresented in genomic studies.

    Daniel Harris is a postdoctoral research fellow in Dr. Sarah Tishkoff's lab at the University of Pennsylvania. He studies African genetic variation to analyze the genetic architecture of cardiometabolic diseases and construct models of African demographic history. Before his postdoctoral research fellowship he completed his PhD at the University of Maryland, Baltimore where he was advised by Dr. Timothy O'Connor. During his PhD his research focused on how genetic drift and migration impact modern human populations.
