    title: "Understanding physiological and health behavior pathways linking minority stress to carotid IMT and carotid plaque burden: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis"
    abstract: >
        Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among men and women over the age of 65 in the United States, racial/ethnic minorities are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing a CVD event as compared to their White counterparts. One pathway through which these disparities are posited to arise is through exposure to racial discrimination. Minority stress theory suggests that racial discrimination increases the likelihood of dysregulated physiological stress and poorer health behaviors (e.g., substance use), of which are linked to increased CVD risk. The objective of this proposal is to examine physiological and behavioral mechanisms linking discrimination to carotid ultrasound measures (i.e., carotid IMT, carotid plaque burden, and grayscale carotid texture features) among individuals who participated in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study.

bio: >
    Dr. Stephanie Cook is an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Biostatistics and Social and Behavioral Sciences at New York University’s College of Global Public Health. Dr. Cook's research interests center on understanding how daily (e.g., microaggressions, financial stress) and global (e.g., childhood adversity, poverty) stressors influence cardiovascular disease risk. Overall, Dr. Cook hopes to inform the development of interventions that reduce the impact of stress on long-term cardiovascular health, especially for racial/ethnic and sexual minority populations.
