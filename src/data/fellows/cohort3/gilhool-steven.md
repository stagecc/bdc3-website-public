    title: Large-scale genome-wide Rare Variant and Copy Number Variant analyses of asthmatics across diverse populations
    abstract: >
        Rare variants (RVs) can contribute significantly to complex traits such as asthma, and are often population-specific. Copy number variants (CNVs), too, can be highly penetrant. Yet, most genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to date have probed common single-nucleotide variants in cohorts of primarily European descent. I will address these issues by building genome-wide RV and CNV analysis pipelines on the Terra platform, and analyzing a set of racially diverse cohorts. I will also investigate the effect of obesity, which is often comorbid with asthma and, like asthma, impacts certain underrepresented populations disproportionately. This project will be well-powered to identify genes harboring novel variants that impact asthma heritability. In future work, our findings can be validated biologically to design precision medicine-based treatments.

    Steve Gilhool is a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Applied Genomics at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He earned his PhD in astrophysics, analyzing large data sets in order to measure properties of stars and better understand their structure and evolution. His current research centers on developing and applying machine learning techniques in order to extract useful information from medical records and genomic data. Through his work, he hopes to make a lasting contribution to the field of precision medicine. Steve enjoys spending time with his family and listening to audiobooks.
