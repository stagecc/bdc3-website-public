  title: Host genetics and gut microbiota in asthma among US Hispanics/Latinos
  abstract: >
    Asthma is a heterogeneous condition influenced by genetic predisposition and environmental stimuli. Recent evidence has implicated the gut microbiota (GM) in the etiology of asthma. This project will capitalize on GM and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from the TOPMed HCHS/SOL cohort of Hispanics/Latinos to investigate how GM characteristics relate to asthma and to a polygenic risk score (PRS) for asthma, while evaluating and accounting for the impacts of obesity and demographic/environmental factors. This project will be the largest study to date of GM characteristics and asthma, and the first such study to examine both GM and genetics among Hispanics/Latinos. This work has the potential to inform GM-based prevention therapies and methods to reduce asthma-triggering immune responses and improvements in asthma subtyping.

  Maggie Stanislawski is a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and her work aims to understand the role of the gut microbiome and related molecular profiles in health and disease, specifically obesity, cardiometabolic disease and inflammatory conditions. Before completing her PhD in Epidemiology with the Colorado School of Public Health, Dr. Stanislawski worked as a statistician with the Veterans Administration doing Cardiovascular Health Outcomes Research. She completed her bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at Pomona College and a master’s degree in Statistics at Colorado State University.
