  title: Using a multi-omics approach to assess X chromosome inactivation (XCI) skewing in females and its association with hematological and hemostasis traits
  abstract: >
    Dosage compensation in XX females and XY males is achieved through transcriptional silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in mammalian female cells. This process, known as X chromosome inactivation (XCI) occurs early in development and can influence the expression of X-linked traits and disease phenotypes in females. Our aim is to leverage multi-omics datasets in TOPMed to study XCI and broadly understand its impact on hematological and hemostasis traits. This study will, for the first-time, perform large-scale genomic analyses of XCI and will uncover novel insights into how XCI influences female health and disease.
