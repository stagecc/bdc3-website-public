  title: Genomics of Weight Loss in COPD
  abstract: >
    Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with mortality continuing to rise. Cachexia, whose hallmark is weight loss, increases risk of death and healthcare expenditure. We will expand our previous genome-wide association study analyses which identified several regions associated with weight loss in COPD by performing whole-genome-sequence analyses in 7 TOPMed cohorts. I will implement several tools in BDC providing feedback on difficulties encountered as well as helpful features. Through this fellowship I will have dedicated time to work on implementing my lab’s analysis pipelines as well as accomplish my goal to identify genomic variation associated with weight-loss in COPD.

  Merry-Lynn McDonald is the Director of Integrative ‘Omics and an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. She is a genetic epidemiologist with interests in the analysis of complex traits and diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cachexia, sarcopenia, osteoarthritis and smoking behaviors such as menthol. Her project is focused on gaining insight to the genomics of weight loss in COPD.
