  title: Modeling lifetime coronary artery disease trajectories of naturally occurring DNA variation linked to low circulating triglycerides
  abstract: >
    Circulating triglyceride (‘fat’) concentrations are an important and causal driver of coronary artery disease, which is rising globally in step with the obesity epidemic. Our team has led efforts to identify individuals with inborn protection from high triglyceride levels via a single DNA mutation of large-effect (‘monogenic’) or the cumulative impact of many variants (‘polygenic’). Here, I propose to model longitudinal trajectories of triglyceride concentrations and coronary artery disease according to these factors, using whole-genome sequencing data from 56,203 individuals across 13 TOPMed cohorts. Beyond the scientific innovation of this proposed work and reflecting a deep commitment to the BioData Catalyst ecosystem, I will build scalable and shareable analytic pipelines that will be generalizable to the genomics community.

  Jacqueline Dron is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for Genomic Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, in the lab of Dr. Amit Khera. Her research focuses on leveraging genetic and non-genetic data to identify subtypes and new pathways driving risk of coronary artery disease, as well as better understanding classical risk factors, such as lipids. Here, Dr. Dron’s proposed research will characterize the monogenic and polygenic determinants underlying triglyceride levels by exploring genome-wide polygenic scores and polygenic modifications to loss-of-function variants.
