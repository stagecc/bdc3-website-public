  title: Comprehensive analysis of omics signatures across race/ethnic groups and implications for cardiometabolic diseases
  abstract: >
    The advent of omics studies offers an unparalleled opportunity to understand the processes involved in the development of complex traits such as cardiometabolic outcomes. Genetic studies have shown substantial differences in molecular associations with disease across ancestries, but this has been ignored for other omics. Recent evidence support the use of metabolomics and other omics to identify metabolic pathways or biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk. The multi-ethnic insight is necessary to understand the disease pathogenesis and to develop future research on tailored interventions. We aim to identify the differences in omics signatures (epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) across different ethnic groups and assess the extent to which these variations affect the prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes.

  Magdalena Sevilla-Gonzalez is a postdoctoral research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute. She earned her PhD and masterâ€™s degree in Health Sciences at the National University of Mexico (UNAM), where she participated in the physiological characterization of Mexican-specific gene variants associated with metabolic traits. Her current research with Dr. Alisa Manning focuses on using comprehensive statistical approaches to study complex diseases. Her research vision is to integrate multi-omics and environmental exposures of diverse populations to enhance interventions and early detection of common diseases such as type 2 diabetes in high-risk populations.
