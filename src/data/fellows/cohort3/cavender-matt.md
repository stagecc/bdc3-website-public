  title: "Team Proposal Utilization of Machine Learning Techniques to Identify Clinical and Genetic Determinants of Calcific Aortic Valve Disease"
  abstract: >
    Aortic stenosis is a frequent cause of heart failure in the elderly that occurs when deposition of calcium on the aortic valve prevents mobility of the valve and diminishes the flow across the valve. Our central hypothesis is that patients with aortic sclerosis have characteristics and genetic polymorphisms that differ from patients without aortic sclerosis and that these differences can be identified using machine learning techniques. We aim to 1) Develop a cross-study cohort (approximately 17,000 patients) by harmonizing data from multiple cardiovascular studies; 2) Identify individual demographic and clinical factors associated with aortic sclerosis with various machine learning methods, including regression and random forests. 3) Determine whether identified factors, including genetic polymorphisms related to lipid metabolism, lipoprotein (a), and coronary artery disease have collinearity or cluster together. Achievement of these aims will add considerable insight in the mechanisms responsible for the development of aortic stenosis and result in pooled, harmonized datasets available for future analyses. The tools built to evaluate clustering and independent relationships will be made available as scalable workflows accessible to the BDC research community.
