  title: Development of robust and efficient pipelines for identifying tandem repeat expansions in whole genome sequencing data, and its application to congenital heart defects
  abstract: >
    Tandem Repeat Expansions (TREs) underlie >40 human diseases, including a growing list of congenital anomalies. However, due to technical difficulties, they are typically overlooked by standard genome-wide analysis. We hypothesize that some cases of CHD are caused by rare, highly penetrant pathogenic TREs. To test this, I plan to develop end-to-end analytical pipelines for analyzing whole-genome sequence (WGS) data on BDC using the newly developed algorithms STRetch, ExpansionHunter and gangSTR, thus allowing the rapid and cost-effective identification of TREs in any cohort of interest. We will then apply these pipelines to screen 1,800 WGS trios from cases with congenital heart defects (CHDs) to search for rare de novo pathogenic TREs. In addition to identifying genuine pathogenic TREs that might underlie CHD, this work will facilitate the wide-scale deployment of novel tools to the scientific community, opening the door to analysis of tandem repeat variation in TOPMed and other large cohorts.

  Alejandro Martin Trujillo is a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Dr. Andrew Sharp at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. During his PhD, he focused on the identification of parent-of-origin allelic methylation in humans using high-density microarrays, identifying many novel imprinted loci, and thus helping to characterize the full extent of the human imprintome. After his PhD, he moved to Dr. Sharpâ€™s lab where he is investigating the prevalence and impact of rare (epi)genetic variation in human disease using data generated from high-throughput technologies such as microarrays and NGS  in combination with creative computational approaches.
