  title: Recurrent Somatic Variation in TOPMed Whole Genomes
  abstract: >
    Aging is characterized by the acquisition of mutations in blood. Recently, interest has emerged in TOPMed regarding the use of somatic variant calls, which are referenced in paper proposals of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). However many scientific questions remain unresolved, including a clear survey of recurrent somatic variation. To support this work there is need for additional software development to process the somatic variant calls into easily accessible data products, analogous to efforts on the germline calls. The BDC ecosystem is the ideal platform for the development of further tooling to accelerate analyses of somatic variation, facilitating reproducible workflows for analysis on somatic variant calls.
