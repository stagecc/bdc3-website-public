  title: Identifying an asymptomatic malaria population using whole genome sequence data
  abstract: >
    According to the World Health Organization, nearly half of the worldâ€™s population is at risk for malaria, and the majority of this disease burden is within Africa. Elimination efforts that commenced in the 1950s have dramatically reduced the global incidence, but the efforts are not on track for total elimination as hoped. There are several explanations as to why interventions have not been as successful as expected; one theory is failed elimination efforts could be caused by the presence of asymptomatic carriers of the parasite in these endemic populations. These individuals go undetected by traditional surveillance methods, because they are never evaluated by health professionals. Thus, it is imperative to uncover what allows this population to repress the parasite to the point of remaining asymptomatic. The proposed study will utilize whole genome sequence data to fully define this population in three African countries (Ghana, Kenya and Cameroon) which hinder current elimination goals by 1) using unmapped sequencing reads to study the epidemiologic patterns of the infection in the asymptomatic populations and which species of Plasmodium dominate; 2) uncover the underlying host genetics that allow the individuals to suppress the infection to the point where they go undetected.

  Jasmine Olvany is a PhD candidate pursuing a degree in Genetics and Genome Sciences at Case Western Reserve University under the guidance of Dr. Scott Williams and Dr. Peter Zimmerman. Her thesis work focuses on a problematic asymptomatic population that hinders malaria elimination, which allows her to conduct research at the intersection of genetics and infectious disease. Prior to her PhD studies, she completed a Fulbright scholarship in Budapest, Hungary, where she researched bioorthogonal dyes. Outside of her graduate experience, she is an artist who dabbles in both ceramics and jewelry.
