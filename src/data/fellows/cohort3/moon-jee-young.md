  title: Host Genetics and Gut Microbiome
  abstract: >
    Compelling evidence indicates that gut microbiota plays an important role in human disease by modulating immune response, inflammation and metabolism. On the other hand, gut microbiota is also influenced by host genetics and disease status. To understand this complex interplay, the focus of our study is to identify the gut microbial features regulated by host genetics and further examine the circulating metabolites in the downstream of this regulation, using whole genome sequencing (WGS), fecal metagenomics, and blood metabolomics data.

  Jee-Young Moon is an Assistant Professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She received bachelor’s degrees in mathematics and biology from POSTECH in South Korea. She did her PhD in statistics at the University of Wisconsin – Madison as she was fascinated by the role of statistical models to enhance the understanding of biological mechanisms. She has extensive experience on GWAS, Mendelian randomization, and causal inference. She enjoys navigating through various omics data, and her current research focus is on understanding interrelationships between genomics, gut microbiota and metabolomics.
