  title: Psychosocial stress, DNA methylation, and incident atherosclerotic disease
  abstract: >
    I will identify epigenomic (DNA methylation) signatures linking psychosocial stress with incident atherosclerotic disease. Given the complexity of these phenotypes, I expect that changes at individual epigenetic sites within specific blood cell types contribute small effect sizes, which cannot be detected by conventional single-cohort analyses. By leveraging the large sample sizes and enhanced computational tools enabled by BDC, I will identify novel whole blood and cell type-specific DNA methylation changes associated with stress burden. The identified epigenetic signatures will then be used to construct stress-associated DNA methylation scores that predict incidence of atherosclerotic disease. My broad expertise and previous publications at the interface of stress biology and cardiovascular medicine position me uniquely to lead this important cross-disciplinary project.

  Anthony Zannas is an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Genetics at UNC-Chapel Hill. Following his MD and general clinical training in Greece, he completed a masterâ€™s on the Science of Stress at Athens University and trained at Duke Psychiatry. He then did a PhD and postdoc in Molecular Biology at the Max Planck Institute and Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. His research work examines how epigenomic patterns result from stressful experiences and, in turn, shape disease trajectories. His translational work combines large-scale analyses in human cohorts with mechanistic investigations in cell models.
