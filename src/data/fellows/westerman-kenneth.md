    title: Identification and Characterization of Diet-Responsive Genetic Loci for Glycemic Traits
    abstract: >
        Gene-diet interactions can improve our understanding of cardiometabolic traits and inform precision nutrition, but they suffer from low power and poor molecular characterization. We hypothesize that a multi-exposure approach to gene-environment interaction testing combined with molecular characterization using metabolomics will allow the discovery of a robust set of diet-interacting loci for glycemic traits. The BioData Catalyst will provide access to the diverse set of TOPMed cohorts and an environment for running cloud-based workflows. This project will demonstrate the value of the BDC in enabling impactful, computationally-intensive research and create additional workflows to be made available for future users.
bio: Kenny Westerman is a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute. He is interested in developing improved approaches to precision nutrition using genomic and bioinformatic methods. Westerman received his PhD in Biochemical and Molecular Nutrition from Tufts University and is now a part of the Manning Laboratory, where his work involves the development of software and cloud workflows for large-scale gene-environment interaction analysis. His current projects aim to apply these tools to uncover novel gene-diet interactions and develop molecular predictors of personalized response to diet.
