    title: Investigating the Role of Short Tandem Repeat Expansions in Congenital Heart Disease and Developing an Str Variation Resource for the Prioritization of Pathogenic Loci
    abstract: >
        Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), are highly mutable 1–6bp repetitive DNA sequences that comprise 3% of the human genome. There are >40 Mendelian STR disease loci, including “novel” STRs (absent from the reference). While several STRs impact atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, little is known about STRs in Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). Since previous STR research has focused on known STR loci, I have developed STRling, a new method for unbiased detection of both novel and known STR expansions genome-wide. Using >3000 TOPMed genomes I will release a novel and reference STR variation resource, and use this to prioritize variants in CHD patients.
bio: Harriet Dashnow is a bioinformatics postdoc in Aaron Quinlan’s Lab at the University of Utah. She did her PhD research with Alicia Oshlack at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Australia. She is best known for computational methods to detect short tandem repeat expansions. She has also published bioinformatic methods for clinical exome sequencing and microbial gene detection. Harriet has a BA (Psychology), a BSc (Genetics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology), a MSc (Bioinformatics) and PhD from the University of Melbourne in Australia. She enjoys teaching computational skills workshops in such areas as genomics, data analysis, programming and version control. She co-authored the O’Reilly programming book Elegant SciPy.
