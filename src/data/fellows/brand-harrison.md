    title: Investigation of the Impact of Structural Variation on the Genetic Etiology of Type 2 Diabetes and Glycemic Traits
    abstract: >
        The contribution of structural variation (SV) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been largely unexplored. During this fellowship I will take advantage of the NHLBI BioData Catalyst ecosystem to run an ensemble SV detection pipeline on 26,037 TOPMed samples with T2DM and/or related glycemic traits. Integrating this newly generated SV callset with existing data I will explore both common and rare genetic risk factors for diabetes. This study will not only provide a useful SV callset for TOPMed investigators but also establish a beneficial tool in the Biodata Catalyst and provide important feedback to the BioData Catalyst developers.

    Harrison Brand’s scientific career has included a diverse set of research pursuits that have reflected a natural evolution towards his ultimate goal of understanding how genetic variation contributes to complex disease. After completion of his PhD in Human Genetics, he accepted a postdoc position in the lab of Dr. Michael Talkowski at the Center for Genomic Medicine at MGH investigating the impact of structural variation (SV) on developmental disorders. Upon completion of his postdoc, Dr. Brand accepted a junior faculty position in the Department of Neurology at MGH, where he continues to evaluate the impact of SV on disease.
