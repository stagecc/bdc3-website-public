Upon receipt of the invitation from dbGaP to complete study registration, you can begin the data upload process. Data submission to BDC can happen in parallel to Step 2 of the study registration process.

Contact the NHLBI Data Management Core (DMC) via [https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact), select the "Data Submission" Type, and request one of the following methods for data package upload:

- Access for Read/write permission to the assigned cloud bucket.
- Link your credentials (Amazon/Google) and get access to the AWS S3 or GCP web user interface for data upload.
- Request assistance for direct data upload from your data package location (e.g. sFTP transfer).

***Note:** Please confirm the submission contents before uploading into the NHLBI cloud bucket.*
