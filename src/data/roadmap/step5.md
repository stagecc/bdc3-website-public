Once all the submission content (“Data Package”) is uploaded successfully, the ingestion and release process can take approximately 4-6 weeks from when data quality checks are completed by the BioData Catalyst team. 

The data will go through quality checks before ingestion and release. If issues are found, a member of the DMC will contact you to resolve any issues before ingestion and release. 

Once any data issues are resolved, you may be asked to resubmit the data package.

After the data is released, you will receive notification from the BioData Catalyst Data Management Core that your study is available for use by authorized individuals in BDC ([Study Inventory](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/studies)).

You are encouraged to log in and view your study data in the BDCBiodata Catalyst Ecosystem ([Analytic Platform](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/services)).
