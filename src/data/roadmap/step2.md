All research data shared with BDC must be registered through **dbGaP*** (exceptions may apply).

There are two steps to registering a study in dbGaP:

### Step A: *Completed by the Genomic Program Administrator (GPA)*
In this step the GPA will complete the registration process in dbGaP.
- The information from the Institutional Certification and Data Submission Information Sheet you submitted will be entered into the dbGaP Submission System by the GPA.
  - ***Note**: The NHLBI GPA may reach out to you for additional information or clarification. You may be asked to provide a Data Sharing Plan and Data Use agreement.*
- An accession number for your study will be generated. 
  - ***Note**: Note: The GPA will share the accession number and the consent group information with the BioData Catalyst Data Management Core to create Data Submission Infrastructure for your study.*

### Step B:
Once you receive an email from dbGaP, please complete the registration process. Refer to the [dbGaP Registration for BioData Catalyst Guidance](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/data-management/dbgap-registration-for-biodata-catalyst).

Upon receipt of the invitation from dbGaP to complete study registration, you can begin the data upload process as defined in Step 4 below. Data submission to BDC and dbGaP registration completion can occur in parallel.
