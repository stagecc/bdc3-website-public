Join us on Wednesday, August 25th at 1 pm EDT for an informal, <a href="https://bit.ly/3ArDjuj" target="_blank">virtual event </a>where you will learn about the analysis workspaces on BioData Catalyst from team members of Seven Bridges and Terra. Reps from these teams will be providing an introduction to and a tour of their workspaces. We will also discuss how you can request Pilot Credits to get started on these platforms. After a demo and presentation from these teams, time will be made available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing on the ecosystem.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BioData Catalyst or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to join our<a href="https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem" target="_blank"> community</a>.

To get the most out of this opportunity, we recommend including your <a href="https://forms.gle/1QfSZkWkpprWnJhv5" target="_blank"> questions in advance</a>, but we do accept questions and issues during the meeting if time allows. Questions can be specific to this sessionâ€™s topic of analysis workspaces, or they can be about any component of the ecosystem you might be curious about.

Make sure to <a href="https://bit.ly/3ArDjuj" target="_blank"> register now</a> - we look forward to seeing you!

### What are Community Hours?

BioData Catalyst Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
