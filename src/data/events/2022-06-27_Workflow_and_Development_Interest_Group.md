*This group meets every third Monday of the month, from 1:30 - 2:30 p.m. ET. Registration is not necessary; use the Zoom link or meeting details to join.*

Goals: Showcase the utility of reproducible analysis workflows by inviting community researchers to talk through their research questions and path to answers. Platform demonstrations and workspace tours will take place in an informal presentation and discussion setting. All workflow languages will be represented in the group, based on the preferred workflow language of the presenter.

Please join the Workflow and Development Interest Group for this month's "Meet the Scientist" on [June 27th, 2022 at 1:30 p.m. ET](https://renci.zoom.us/j/99606818968?pwd=S2kwdW5ZbCtabjRYcHRQYWM4NnZkUT09), for our next exploration on how the cloud platform is facilitating the research of our community members. See below for full flyer and research topic.
