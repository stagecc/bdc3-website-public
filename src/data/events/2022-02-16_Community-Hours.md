Join us on [Wednesday, February 16th at 1 p.m. ET](https://bit.ly/3nGT8sZ) for a session with Dockstore and Seven Bridges on reproducible research methods in BioData Catalyst. This informal, virtual event will be focused on reproducibility when creating and sharing tools and workflows. Members of the Dockstore team will discuss best practices for creating FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) workflows, including hosting your workflow on GitHub to leverage its version control, release management, and collaborative environment. 


Take-aways include:
- Why publish your workflow on Dockstore?
- How to create a FAIR workflow on Dockstore
- How to register your workflow on GitHub and sync automatically with Dockstore
- Setting your workflow up to be citable
- Seven Bridges Tool editor
- Exporting tools to Dockstore
- Highlight previously published work in Dockstore

As always, time will be available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BioData Catalyst or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem).

You are welcome to anonymously include your [questions in advance](https://forms.gle/hR9noQnAUcSn5STt7) or bring your discussion topics to the session live.

### What are Community Hours?

BioData Catalyst Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
