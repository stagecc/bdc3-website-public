Join us on **[Wednesday, June 22nd at 1:00 pm ET](https://bit.ly/3Mv0YAy)** for BioData Catalyst Community Hours. This informal, virtual event  will be focused on **SAS Studio on BioData Catalyst** with a researcher spotlight on **COVID-19 data harmonization**.

## Agenda and Key Takeaways:

### SAS Studio

-   How to run SAS on BioData Catalyst Powered by Seven Bridges.

-   The principles of SAS, with some example code annotated with instructions to modify and customize to user needs.

-   Demonstration using SAS to perform analysis on the CDC SVI data.

### COVID-19 Data Harmonization

Researcher Pallavi Balte will present her work using BioData Catalyst for COVID-19 data harmonization. About her research:Â 

-   C4R links pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) phenotyping to information on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute and postacute COVID-related illness. Data are harmonized with research-quality phenotyping unmatched by clinical and survey-based studies; these data will be pooled and shared widely to expedite collaboration and scientific findings. This resource will allow evaluation of risk and resilience factors for COVID-19 severity and outcomes, including postacute sequelae, and assessment of the social and behavioral impact of the pandemic on long-term health trajectories.

-   [Read more about Pallavi's research on PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35279711/).

After a presentation and demo on these topics, time will be made available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BioData Catalyst or have been using it for some time.

## What are Community Hours?

BioData Catalyst Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
