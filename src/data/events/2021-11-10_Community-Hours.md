Join us on Wednesday, November 10th from 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm EDT for an informal, [virtual event](https://bit.ly/3DJez2i) where you will learn about workflows on BioData Catalyst from team members of Dockstore. Reps from these teams will be covering a variety of topics related to workflows, including:

* Introduction to workflows in BioData Catalyst
* What is a container?
* What is a workflow?
* What is Dockstore?
* Dockstore Demo
* Resources to Get Started

The demo will show how to find and launch workflows as well as how to publish your own workflows.

After a presentation and demo on these topics, time will be made available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BioData Catalyst or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to join our [community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem).

To get the most out of this opportunity, we recommend including your [questions in advance](https://forms.gle/n4P2v8NMNfvzEfCH6), but we do accept questions and issues during the meeting if time allows. Questions can be specific to this sessionâ€™s topic of data access and exploration, or they can be about any component of the ecosystem you might be curious about.

Make sure to [register now](https://bit.ly/3DJez2i) - we look forward to seeing you!

### What are Community Hours?

BioData Catalyst Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
