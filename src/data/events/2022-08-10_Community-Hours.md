Join us on **[Wednesday, August 10th at 1:00 pm ET](https://renci.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcqcu6prDMuGdWme-2u9oFUJ284Mogi48JT)**: Dr. Alisa Manning will demo performing parts of a **genome-wide association study (GWAS) using TOPMed data in *BioData Catalyst Powered by Terra***. The demo will focus on how to run the computations and interrogate the results of a GWAS, building off of an analysis plan she describes in a previous webinar [here](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/5028791354395-Performing-a-GWAS-on-Terra-BioData-Catalyst-Webinar-March-29-2022-). We recommend you [watch the previous webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st16Sp34_dg) to catch the initial steps of preparing data and phenotypes in a workspace. 

The ideal audience for this event are TOPMed analysts authorized to use dbGaP data, but all community members are welcome to attend.

After a presentation and demo on these topics, time will be made available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BioData Catalyst or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem). If you cannot attend on this date, you can still sign up and the recording and slides will be sent to you.

You are welcome to anonymously [include your questions in advance](https://forms.gle/JpNWQbLXoxzro5zi9) or bring your discussion topics to the session live.

Make sure to [register now](https://renci.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcoc-2vrzouGdXVpgP_l5DCXVd1ONu-nNgj) - we look forward to seeing you!

### What are Community Hours?

BioData Catalyst Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
