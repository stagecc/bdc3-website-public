Join Dr. Maggie Stanislawski and Dr. Liz Litowski on [Wednesday, May 22 1pm EST](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/2517110288834/WN_0Y88g4nPTbatp8iJRENXoA) as they share and expand on their recent conference presentation from the TOPMed Annual Meeting in February. Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases in the world. Asthma prevalence varies widely across populations with particularly notable differences in Hispanic/Latino subgroups. Prevalence tends to be relatively low in Mexican Americans and extremely high in Puerto Rican Americans, which is partly due to different environmental exposures and genetic risk factors in these populations. Recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota characteristics might also contribute to asthma, but these relationships have mostly been studied in childhood asthma. As part of a BioData Catalyst Fellows project, they examined associations between gut microbiota characteristics and asthma in Hispanic/Latino adults. They found many associations between gut microbiota characteristics and asthma in this population, which were particularly strong in individuals with both asthma and obesity. Their results provide insight into mechanisms involved in both asthma and obesity.

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/2517110288834/WN_0Y88g4nPTbatp8iJRENXoA) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem/).

Make sure to [register now](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/2517110288834/WN_0Y88g4nPTbatp8iJRENXoA) - we look forward to seeing you!
