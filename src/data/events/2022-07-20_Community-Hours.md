Join us on **[Wednesday, July 20th at 1:00 pm ET](https://renci.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcoc-2vrzouGdXVpgP_l5DCXVd1ONu-nNgj)** to learn about BioData Catalyst’s many features that are of value to **sickle cell disease-related research**. You’ll hear from platform representatives about the several sickle cell disease-specific datasets available in the ecosystem, **upcoming features to link external metadata** to these studies, and how to **leverage SAS in the cloud**. Additionally, you’ll hear firsthand the **use case of researcher Brandon Lê** using BioData Catalyst to conduct sickle cell disease research.

**About Brandon Lê**

Brandon Lê, a BioData Catalyst Cohort 2 Fellow, is a PhD candidate at Duke University studying the genetic modifiers of sickle cell disease. His project analyzes several TOPMed SCD cohorts to find associations with renal dysfunction. Through genome-wide association studies of common genetic variants and meta-analyses, several genetic variants statistically associated with renal dysfunction have been identified. This research serves as a foundation for analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data to find additional omic associations, as well as development of deep learning tools to improve prediction power.

BioData Catalyst enabled this research to be effortlessly scaled up to additional cohorts. The BDC ecosystem provided the tools and infrastructure needed to replicate an analysis pipeline to additional cohorts without the burden of modifying scripts for each individual fileset or navigating high-performance computing services. Consequently, BDC has enabled these analyses to be massively parallelized, saving time and effort. The use of BDC-maintained and versioned applications and workflows also means these analyses are reproducible for follow-up work and publications.

After a presentation and demo on these topics, time will be made available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BioData Catalyst or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem). If you cannot attend on this date, you can still sign up and the recording and slides will be sent to you.

You are welcome to anonymously [include your questions in advance](https://forms.gle/JpNWQbLXoxzro5zi9) or bring your discussion topics to the session live.

Make sure to [register now](https://renci.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcoc-2vrzouGdXVpgP_l5DCXVd1ONu-nNgj) - we look forward to seeing you!

### What are Community Hours?

BioData Catalyst Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
