  title: "June Community Hours: Discrimination and Carotid Intima-media Thickness: A Multi-Ethnic Study"
  description:

Join Assistant Professor Stephanie Cook as she discusses her latest research, [recently published in the Journal of the American Heart Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.032659). The study was conducted during her BDC Fellowship using the [MESA dataset](https://www.mesa-nhlbi.org/). It hypothesized that cigarette use would mediate the association between discrimination and carotid artery disease features, and that these would differ by race and ethnicity.

Following Assistant Professor Cook, BDC Steering Committee Chair Dr. Ingrid Borecki will address early career scientists, particularly those in the [NHLBI Programs for Inclusion and Diversity Among Individuals Engaged in Health-Related Research (PRIDE) Program](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/training-and-career-development/diversity/pride). Dr. Borecki will discuss the value of cloud computing models, particularly BDC, for early career scientists and PRIDE participants as they embark on their journeys as scholars, researchers, and investigators.

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/2517158800984/WN_3CouMg1wR8Gvyu4jgG7iUw) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem/).

Make sure to [register now](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/2517158800984/WN_3CouMg1wR8Gvyu4jgG7iUw) - we look forward to seeing you!
