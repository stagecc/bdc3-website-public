Join us on [Wednesday, April 17 1pm EST](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/6017103574726/WN_zfMDQHXWQu-vn6XLfprwjw) for April Community Hours: Teaching with BDC. Using BDC in your courses supports teaching and learning computational methods, reinforcing concepts taught in other classes, and bridging learning into research. Students (and instructors) may be short on the coding skills needed to get started in other environments but can start using BDC resources immediately. 

BDC offers code-forward and no-code informatics methods, and you will learn how to use both. This allows for focusing on teaching and learning the science rather than learning a new coding language. After your course, you and your students can still use BDC resources, and BDC can support their further skill acquisition by providing coding environments within the now-familiar BDC ecosystem.

In this session, you'll learn how to set up course materials, including test data, methods, example analyses, and how to provide access to files and code. We will also showcase administrative tools, which allow instructors to help or provide feedback to students in real-time or asynchronously.

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/6017103574726/WN_zfMDQHXWQu-vn6XLfprwjw) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem/).

Make sure to [register now](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/6017103574726/WN_zfMDQHXWQu-vn6XLfprwjw) - we look forward to seeing you!

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
