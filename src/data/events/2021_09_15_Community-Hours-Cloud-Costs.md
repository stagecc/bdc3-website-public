Join us on Wednesday, September 15th from 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm EDT for an informal, [virtual event](https://renci.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwpd--oqDsjG92aiAgPKQHzNILKgC8gZYVq) where you will learn about Cloud Costs on BioData Catalyst from team members of Seven Bridges, Terra, and the BioData Catalyst Coordinating Center. Reps from these teams will be talking about a variety of topics related to cloud costs, including:

- Cloud computing
- Requesting pilot funding
- Best practices for benchmarking your pilot analyses, including budgeting for scale
- Writing BioData Catalyst into your grant proposal
- What you can do on the ecosystem while you are waiting for funding

After a presentation and demo on these topics, time will be made available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BioData Catalyst or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to <a href="https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem" target="_blank"> join our community</a>.

To get the most out of this opportunity, we recommend including your [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdETlftk70Qp-uYXrpefhI6DylVHO62OLsEp1M_PnWqe8zqOA/viewform](questions in advance), but we do accept questions and issues during the meeting if time allows. Questions can be specific to this sessionâ€™s topic of cloud costs, or they can be about any component of the ecosystem you might be curious about.

### What are Community Hours?

BioData Catalyst Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
