Join us on [Wednesday, August 23 at 1 PM ET](https://bit.ly/BDC-August) for a  Showcase featuring [TOPMed Fellow Matthew Goodman, PhD](https://topmed.nhlbi.nih.gov/awards/15742), whose current research focuses on gene-environment interactions (GxE) and polygenic risk scores. With a team of researchers, he is assessing the impact that sleep-related exposures have on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, and pre-existing genetic risk for hypertension. The initial aim is to study how to efficiently compute pathway-specific polygenic risk scores (PS-PRS) for multiple phenotypes and thousands of pathways across all individuals in TOPMed that have sequence data available. The software will be implemented on BDC during the study and made available for other users to use. 

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](http://bit.ly/BDC-August) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.

Time will be made available for discussion and to address questResearcherions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem. You are welcome to [anonymously include your questions in advance](https://forms.gle/iPifJTM5q2eeKa7UA) or bring your discussion topics to the session live.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem/).

Make sure to [register now](http://bit.ly/BDC-August) - we look forward to seeing you!

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
