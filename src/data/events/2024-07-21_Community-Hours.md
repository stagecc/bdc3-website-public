  title: "July Community Hours: Exploration of RECOVER on BDC"
  description:
---
RECOVER is a first-of-its-kind, patient-centered research initiative to understand, diagnose, and treat Long COVID. RECOVER research includes observational cohort studies, electronic health records analyses, pathobiology studies, tissue pathology studies, and clinical trials.

This Community Hours is designed to support you in your exploration of RECOVER data available in BDC.

The session will begin with an open access exploration of the data available in BDC. The demonstration includes how to browse the data, filter on variables to build cohorts, and use visualization tools to investigate the cohort without logging in. The session will touch on the limitations of open access as well as the role of data dictionaries and release notes.

The session will continue with a similar guide to authorized access exploration of the RECOVER data available in BDC. This will additionally include how to save cohorts with a unique ID and how to export data to a BDC analysis platform. The session will conclude with a demonstration of BDC cloud cost calculators as well as how to cite and acknowledge BDC in published work.

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/2817182003893/WN_VdJI6isLRMai95eKbEri6Q) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.
