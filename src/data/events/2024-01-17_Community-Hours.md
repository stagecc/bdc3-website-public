Join us on [Wednesday, January 17 2pm ET](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/6517025718497/WN_O0SRkPrnREqb5RN-Gz_lQg) for a session on the Art of the Start.

For our first Community Hours of 2024, we'll be featuring:

-   A great way to get started on BDC: Explore aggregate, obfuscated, destigmatizing, de-identified phenotypic data with PIC-SURE Open Access.
-   A reflection by early career researchers on their career journey, BDC's role in their success, and tips for those starting out.

Do you have an aspiring or early career researcher in your life? Forward this invitation on and invite them to the session.

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
