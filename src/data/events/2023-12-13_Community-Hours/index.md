Join us on Wednesday, December 13 at 1 PM ET for BDC December Community Hours: Ecosystem and Research Highlights. During this session, program leaders, researchers, and BDC community members will recap the highlights of the ecosystem in 2023, and look toward 2024. Highlights include global recognition for the work of BDC researchers and the ecosystem, data ingestion of six Sickle Cell Disease data sets, a December Request for Information opportunity to contribute to the NHLBI strategic plan, and more.

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
