At this session, BDC platform representatives will discuss various tools that can be used to find, search, and query data, including PIC-SURE Open Access for searching authorized datasets and the Seven Bridges Data Browser to locate related sequencing and genotype files.

Time will be made available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time.

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
