Dr. Jose Vargas will present on [Wednesday, February 28 1pm ET](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/8017053302720/WN_D9w_HA-XRM-zMCMIuCSVPQ) for a session on Insights from Genome-Wide Association Studies: Linking Genetics and Imaging.

This talk will go through an overview of basic GWAS and imaging studies and how they are being used in state of the art genetic analyses of cardiovascular disease. A special emphasis will be placed on the importance of diversity in genetic studies.

Clinician Scientist (Cardiologist) Jose Vargas is a previous Postdoc Fellow at NIH Intramural Research Program and Cardiology Fellow at Johns Hopkins. He is currently at US Department of Veterans' Affairs and working with Jorge Kizer's Lab at UCSF combining heart imaging (for phenotype and covariates) and SNP data (TOPMed MESA and SOL).

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
