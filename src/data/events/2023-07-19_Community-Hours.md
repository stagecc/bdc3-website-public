  title: "BDC Community Hours: Linking Phenotypic Data to Genomic Data Files"
  description:
---
Are you a data scientist interested in linking the phenotypic and genomic information of participants within a selected cohort for your research?

Join us on [Wednesday, July 19 at 1 PM ET](https://bit.ly/BDC-July) to learn how to build a cohort and link phenotypic information to genomic data files hosted in the BDC ecosystem. We will showcase how to use BDC Powered by PIC-SURE (BDC-PIC-SURE) to search for variables, apply filters, and export data to a BDC-Seven Bridges workspace. There, we will share how to use the PIC-SURE output to find associated genomic files with the Seven Bridges Data Browser tool and copy these to your personal project to use in workflows and analysis.

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](http://bit.ly/BDC-July) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.

Time will be made available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem. You are welcome to [anonymously include your questions in advance](https://forms.gle/iPifJTM5q2eeKa7UA) or bring your discussion topics to the session live.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem/).\
Make sure to [register now](http://bit.ly/BDC-July) - we look forward to seeing you!

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
