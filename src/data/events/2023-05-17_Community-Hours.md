Join us on [Wednesday, May 17th at 1:00 pm ET](http://bit.ly/BDC-May) to learn about newly published apps on BDC Powered by Seven Bridges. This session will include a demonstration of new workflows for both existing and soon-to-be ingested data types. These live demos will include:

-   [STAAR pipeline](https://github.com/xihaoli/STAARpipeline) for GWAS, which performs phenotype-genotype association analyses using the STAAR procedure. The app is designed for analyzing whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data.

-   [MetaCyto](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MetaCyto.html) workflows for meta-analysis of both flow cytometry and mass cytometry data. Based on the R package, it is able to jointly analyze cytometry data from different studies with diverse sets of markers.

-   [OmicCircos](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/OmicCircos.html) is an R Shiny app created for more effective generation of high-quality circular plots for visualizing genomic data. Common use cases include mutation patterns, copy number variations (CNVs), expression patterns, and methylation patterns. Such variations can be displayed as scatterplot, line, or text-label figures.

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](http://bit.ly/BDC-May) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.

Time will be made available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem. You are welcome to [anonymously include your questions in advance](https://forms.gle/iPifJTM5q2eeKa7UA) or bring your discussion topics to the session live.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem/).

Make sure to [register now](http://bit.ly/BDC-May) - we look forward to seeing you!

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
