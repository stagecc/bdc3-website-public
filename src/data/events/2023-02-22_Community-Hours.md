This session will focus on how to optimize analysis workflows in cloud-based ecosystems, including how to benchmark and make sure you are using funding appropriately. BDC Cohort 3 Fellow Daniel Harris, PhD, will also highlight how his research project optimized workflows.

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
