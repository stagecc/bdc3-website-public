Join us on Wednesday, December 8th from 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm EST for our final BioData Catalyst Community Hours of 2021: Ecosystem and Research Highlights. This informal, [virtual event](https://bit.ly/3H9J1Fi) will have an exciting and conversational agenda:

- Democratizing Data: Studies available on BioData Catalyst, including updates from Gen3 and PIC-SURE

- Democratizing Analysis: Workflows shared by the community to date, with highlights from Dockstore, Seven Bridges, and Terra

- Accelerating Precision Medicine and Research: Hear about studies and presentations citing BioData Catalyst, as well as updates from Fellows; listen to what users have accomplished on the ecosystem so far, and what hopes they have for the future

- Building a Community: How we have been - and will continue to be - a community-centric endeavor, with outreach events, conferences, new users, and new consortia

As always, time will be available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BioData Catalyst or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem).

### What are Community Hours?

BioData Catalyst Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
