Join us on [Wednesday, June 21st at 1:00 pm ET](https://bit.ly/BDC-June) for a researcher showcase with [Bench2Bassinet PCGC/CDDRC Fellow](https://benchtobassinet.com/?page_id=2600) Andrew Blair, whose current research focuses on building CHD candidate regulatory element models for experimental characterization and functionalization. MPRA is a high-throughput experimental technique for systematically evaluating the functional activity of candidate DNA regulatory elements, such as promoters and enhancers. He will discuss an iterative approach for genomic modeling and experimental validation for assessing the functional impact of CHD variants. This research aims to accelerate the development of targeted therapies for individuals with CHD by bridging the gap between genomics and clinical applications.

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](http://bit.ly/BDC-June) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.

Time will be made available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing in the ecosystem. You are welcome to [anonymously include your questions in advance](https://forms.gle/iPifJTM5q2eeKa7UA) or bring your discussion topics to the session live.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem/).

Make sure to [register now](http://bit.ly/BDC-June) - we look forward to seeing you!

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.
