*Michelle Daya, PhD, is a human genetics researcher, with a focus on how genetic makeup influences risk for developing common allergies such as asthma and eczema. Her research was supported in part by the BioData Catalyst Fellowship Program, which she participated in during [Cohort I](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/fellows/cohort1/). For her study, [Multiethnic genome-wide and HLA association study of total serum IgE level](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34536413/), she leveraged data from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program; the Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA); and the Atopic Dermatitis Research Network (ADRN).*

Do you enjoy the smell of freshly cut grass, or do you fall victim to sneezing and an incessantly runny nose from pollen? Do you jump at the chance to scratch household pets such as cats and dogs, or do you fear constant coughing and a scratchy throat from their coats? If you’re the latter in these questions, you're not alone. These symptoms aren’t unheard of for those that suffer from common allergies. Common allergies have markers in the body that scientists are studying to learn more about how to alleviate these types of symptoms. But, in order to understand the markers and how to treat them, researchers also need to understand who is affected.

Historically, many **genome-wide association studies** (GWAS) for allergies, and other diseases as well, were completed in the United States and Europe. This means that what we previously learned was predominantly based on genetics from European ancestry study participants. Dr. Michelle Daya’s study was focused on genetic diversity for levels of a particular trait called total serum IgE (tIgE), which is a marker for allergy. She was able to determine that genetic loci of allergy discovered by previous studies that focused on European populations are very relevant in other population groups – particularly African ancestry and Hispanic and Latino population groups. 
Daya explains, “Previously, researchers couldn’t really say which genetic variants are relevant in other population groups because nobody was able to really bring all of the data together and look at it.” Now, TOPMed and other data resources for her study are available through cloud computing platforms, such as BioData Catalyst. “It's now possible to say something about how relevant previous genetic findings are in different populations.”
For the study, Daya used whole genome genetics data collected by various studies over the past few decades. With measurements of the common marker for allergies, tIgE, she was able to study if there are genetic risk factors that make people more prone to common allergies. The tIgE marker is an important intermediate observable characteristic of allergic disease, and is elevated in individuals suffering from allergic diseases such as asthma and eczema, and even more common conditions such as a stuffy nose.

Daya was also able to look more closely at the relationship between **human leukocyte** antigen (HLA) genes and levels of tIgE. Of the GWAS associations identified for elevated tIgE, the HLA locus is the most consistently associated. One of the aspects of her study was to use whole genome sequence data to determine which HLA alleles a person carries. This type of analysis is very costly in terms of cloud storage and in terms of computer and memory. Reflecting on her fellowship, Daya noted that without the data and analysis tools that BioData Catalyst provides, it would have been difficult to perform this type of research and it would have taken much longer. 

To date, Daya believes her study is the largest GWAS and HLA association study of tIgE focused on ancestrally diverse populations. Her team combined existing tIgE and genome-wide data from three large NIH–funded initiatives, including whole genome sequence (WGS) data from the NHLBI TOPMed program and GWAS array data from the CAAPA and the ADRN, and conducted a GWAS of tIgE in more than 20,000 subjects from 16 studies. For a complete breakdown of ancestry, disease group, and genotyping platform across studies Daya used, refer to [Figure 1: Clinical Characteristics](https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/cms/attachment/48ffd166-2b2a-4d17-9e6b-4df2653a35a1/gr1_lrg.jpg).

Daya’s research was supported in part by the NIH and the NHLBI through the [BioData Catalyst](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/) Fellowship program, as well as by additional NHLBI and NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases grants. Using BioData Catalyst, Daya had convenient access to large genetic datasets and could very easily run analysis using tools available on the platform, spending time on interpreting results rather than writing tools for analysis. For more custom analyses, she had the ability to write her own tools for the platform - the development of standardized analysis pipelines allowed for the re-use by other members of her team and the wider research community. “One thing that is very important in science is reproducible research,” she said. “Working in BioData Catalyst, I was confident that the analysis done could be easily reproduced by others.”

Rather than recommending individuals adopt BioData Catalyst, she encourages academic research institutions to adopt the platform and encourage their students, staff, and faculty to use it. Speaking on her time as a Fellow, she said “I think that federal research money would go much further if institutions adopt cloud computing. You only pay for what you use, and long term it is more cost effective. One of the major additional benefits to moving to BioData Catalyst specifically is that all of the technical details of moving analysis to the cloud have already been taken care of.”

A key message of Daya’s study leads to a bigger picture. Although she studied allergies specifically, researchers can study whether previous genetic findings are relevant in different population groups using data such as that from TOPMed and cloud computing platforms like BioData Catalyst. The more that researchers study diverse population groups, the better care patients can receive.
