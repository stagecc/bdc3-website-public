This week, the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA) [published the BDC Consortium’s manuscript](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocad048/7165700?searchresult=1) about the BDC ecosystem and some of its early successes. Authored by several members of the BDC Consortium (representatives from many organizations working with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to develop the ecosystem), the article offers readers a glimpse into what BDC is, what it does, and how it can help investigators attain their research goals.

As a cloud-based ecosystem, BDC provides tools, applications, and workflows that can be collaboratively used in secure workspaces. It helps researchers mine and properly use data resources and lets them interact with the data in various ways based on their knowledge and experience. The ecosystem provides a venue to advance our understanding of health and disease further and create novel diagnostics, therapies, and prevention strategies. 

Regina Bures, Ph.D., BDC Scientific Program Director at the NHLBI, explains, “the bottom line is, BioData Catalyst is a data ecosystem that facilitates data science to harness data for precision medicine for heart, lung, blood, and sleep research, and it's establishing itself more as it's growing. We're incorporating different types of data…and we’re growing our partnerships within NHLBI, outside of it, and across the NIH.”

Bures explained that the manuscript "gives an overview about how BDC was built...emphasizing the collaborations, how those were leveraged over time, and how they've worked out successfully for the ecosystem. So, I think it'll be exciting...because it tells where we've been and where we are, and now...We're about to launch off where this paper leaves off."

BDC Coordinating Center Principal Investigator Stan Ahalt, Ph.D., added, “Papers [like this] that describe construction of long-term data management platforms exist to socialize the utility of creating such an ecosystem. I’m hoping that this paper will further accelerate the uptake of using common forms of data management at scale and at speed across large industry segments, in this case, the biomedical/health industry. It is a growing trend that areas of disciplinary coherence will gravitate toward sharing data on platforms, so they have a common mechanism to share the data and interoperate workflows across different platforms.” 

Production of such a paper was not, however, an easy effort. Ahalt explained, “It was the work of many people over multiple years. It started at least three years ago, and we went through many different iterations of the paper. Due to its nature and the complexity of the topic, it required a lot of consensus-building across the authors, who all made substantial contributions to the ecosystem, to agree that this was representative of all those contributions to the effort.”

Reaching consensus around the manuscript’s content illustrates BDC’s commitment to collaboration and building a strong and thriving community of practice. Not only is the publication valuable in its own right, but it also provides public acknowledgment of NHLBI’s continued investment and contributions to data science and establishes the seminal reference for publications of future scientific advances destined to come from research conducted in the BDC ecosystem.
