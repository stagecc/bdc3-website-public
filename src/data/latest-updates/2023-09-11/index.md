[Sickle cell disease](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sickle-cell-disease) is an inherited red blood cell disorder that affects over 100,000 people in the United States. The disease is characterized by sickle-shaped (elongated) red blood cells and causes multiple complications such as episodic pain, susceptibility to infections, swelling in the hands and feet, and damage to blood vessels impacting multiple organs, including the eyes, bones, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain. Individuals living with sickle cell disease also have an increased risk for strokes and problems during pregnancy.

There are limited disease-modifying therapies available to individuals living with sickle cell disease. For the most common complication of the disease, vaso-occlusive episodes (severe pain that occurs when the sickle-shaped cells block blood flow to a part of the body), supportive therapies remain the mainstay of treatment. Curative therapies available for individuals with sickle cell disease include hematopoietic stem cell transplant (a blood or bone marrow transplant) and emerging data supporting gene therapy (therapies that aim to treat or cure conditions by modifying the DNA in a person's blood cells) from clinical trials.

BDC hopes to help advance sickle cell disease research by hosting key datasets in its cloud-based ecosystem. BDC hosts several datasets that contain genomic data within [TOPMed](https://topmed.nhlbi.nih.gov/), and, in the past year, [six clinical datasets](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/) related to sickle cell disease have been added:

-   Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease ([CSSCD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002362.v1.p1))

-   Hematopoietic Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease ([HCT for SCD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002385.v1.p1))

-   Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea ([MSH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002348.v1.p1))

-   Optimizing Primary Stroke Prevention in Children with Sickle Cell Anemia ([STOP II](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002386.v1.p1))

-   Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension and Sickle Cell Disease with Sildenafil Therapy ([Walk-PHaSST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002383.v1.p1))

-   Hydroxyurea to Prevent Organ Damage in Children with Sickle Cell Anemia ([Baby Hug](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002415.v1.p1))

While these datasets have been available through NHLBI's [BioLINCC](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/) program for some time, allowing researchers to locally download redacted versions of the data, ingestion of the data into BDC opens up new opportunities for those working in sickle cell disease research.

"There's a lot of opportunity for sickle cell disease researchers to look at this historical data in new ways using what's available on BDC," explained Sweta Ladwa, Chief of the Scientific Solutions Delivery Branch in the Information Technology and Applications Center at NHLBI and Data Management Lead for BDC. "The availability of this data in BDC expands what researchers can readily do, including conducting dynamic cohort generation with data from both people with and without sickle cell disease. In BDC, researchers can also work with genomic and other clinical data using deep learning tools and workflows, so there is the potential for more robust analysis."

BDC offers the sickle cell research community an improved ability to browse the data and facilitates reproducibility. Researchers can collaborate in cloud-based workspaces, create cohorts, and use a variety of tools and workflows to reuse data, conducting secondary analyses of existing data to reproduce existing findings and unveil new insights. Researchers are also able to combine BDC-hosted data with data they can bring to the ecosystem themselves ("Bring Your Own Data" (BYOD)).

In fact, according to NHLBI Blood Division Program Officer Dr. Allison Gillaspy, these were key reasons the data was included in BDC. She explained that while the [Cure Sickle Cell Initiative Metadata Catalog](https://curesicklecell.rti.org/)  allows investigators to search through the curated data elements, it is at the meta-data level only, and BDC reaches scientists and researchers beyond just the Cure Sickle Cell Initiative. NHLBI wanted to allow researchers "to work in that cloud environment....and make these resources available to as many people as possible for as many different uses as they can come up with."

The number of ingested datasets for sickle cell disease - among others - will only increase over time. Gillaspy echoed this idea, stating that the new inclusions relate to sickle cell disease, but "there are many clinical study datasets from current and historical NHLBI-funded research that NHLBI is working to make available within BDC."

BDC is increasing researchers' access to key sickle cell data and providing them with enhanced analysis and collaboration capabilities to advance the research for improved treatments and additional cures that may help more people living with sickle cell disease. This has Ladwa hopeful for the future; "BDC has a variety of complementary data available in the ecosystem. There's a lot more that can be done to support sickle cell disease research in BDC by having different SCD data types (genomics, clinical, etc.) in one place, along with the tools and computational resources to scale analysis. We're always looking for feedback from the research community on data, tools, or apps to support researcher success in contributing to advances for better clinical outcomes."
