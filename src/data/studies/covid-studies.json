    "Description": "ORCHID was a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted at 34 hospitals in the US between April 2 and June 19, 2020. Adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were enrolled, with the last outcome assessment on July 17, 2020. The planned sample size was 510 patients with five interim analyses; however, the trial was stopped at the fourth interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 479 patients.The distribution of the day 14 clinical status score (measured using a 7-category ordinal scale) was not significantly different for patients randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo.Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/.

    "Description": "To describe characteristics, treatment, and outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 early in the pandemic, 1480 consecutive adult inpatients with laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to 57 US hospitals from March 1 to April 1, 2020 were studied.It was found that in a geographically diverse early-pandemic COVID-19 cohort with complete hospital folllow-up, hospital mortality was associated with older age, comorbidity burden, and male sex. Intensive care unit admissions occurred early and were associated with protracted hospital stays. Survivors often required new health care services or respiratory support at discharge.The PETAL Network central institutional review board at Vanderbilt University and the institutional review boards at each participating hospital approved the study or determined that the study was exempt from review.Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/.

    "Description": "The overarching goal of this project is to confirm or refute the role of passive immunization as a safe and efficacious therapy in preventing the progression from mild to severe/critical COVID-19 illness and to understand the immunologic kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after passive immunization.The primary objective is to determine the efficacy and safety of a single dose of convalescent plasma (CP) for preventing the progression from mild to severe COVID-19 illness. The secondary objective is to characterize the immunologic response to CP administration.This study will enroll adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with mild, symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness, who are at high risk for progression to severe/critical illness, but who are clinically stable for outpatient management at randomization.",

    "Description": "This study is an adaptive, prospective, randomized trial designed to compare the effectiveness and safety of antithrombotic therapy with no antithrombotic therapy after hospitalization for 48 hours or longer for COVID-19. For Stage 1 of this study, participants will be randomized to either prophylactic anticoagulation or no anticoagulant therapy for 30 days, and then followed for an additional 60 days after the completion of treatment (total duration of follow-up, approximately 90 days). Biobanking of samples for future biomarker and mechanistic studies will be available for centers able to participate and collect samples from eligible participants. Samples will be collected at the time of enrollment and after the completion of 30 days of therapy.
