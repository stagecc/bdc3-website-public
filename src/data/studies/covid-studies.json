    "Description": "ORCHID was a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted at 34 hospitals in the US between April 2 and June 19, 2020. Adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were enrolled, with the last outcome assessment on July 17, 2020. The planned sample size was 510 patients with five interim analyses; however, the trial was stopped at the fourth interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 479 patients.The distribution of the day 14 clinical status score (measured using a 7-category ordinal scale) was not significantly different for patients randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo.Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/.

    "Name": "Clinical-trial of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in Outpatients",
    "Description": "The overarching goal of this project is to confirm or refute the role of passive immunization as a safe and efficacious therapy in preventing the progression from mild to severe/critical COVID-19 illness and to understand the immunologic kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after passive immunization.The primary objective is to determine the efficacy and safety of a single dose of convalescent plasma (CP) for preventing the progression from mild to severe COVID-19 illness. The secondary objective is to characterize the immunologic response to CP administration.This study will enroll adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with mild, symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness, who are at high risk for progression to severe/critical illness, but who are clinically stable for outpatient management at randomization.",
