about: BioData Catalyst Powered by Terra is a secure and scalable platform for biomedical researchers to import and access data, run analysis tools, and collaborate easily with others, in a secure environment.
service: Share and compute across large genomic and genomic-related datasets. Terra offers a stand-alone computational workspace model that provides a secure collaborative place to organize data, run and monitor Workflow Description Language (WDL) analysis pipelines, and perform interactive analysis using applications such as RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, and the Hail GWAS tool.
---

- Bring data and tools together into a computational workspace, allowing for cross-dataset analysis
- Export data from Gen3 (TOPMed, for example) to Terra, explore data in the Terra Data Library, or bring your own data
- Use the Terra Data Explorer to choose and export subsets of data relevant to you and create your own cohort
- Computate flexibly:
  - Interactive analysis with RStudio or Jupyter Notebooks in Python or R (including Bioconductor)
    +Run analyses in batch with the Workflow Description Language (WDL) and the Cromwell execution engine
  - Perform large scale analytics using BigQuery
- Showcase Workspaces: Pre-configured, pre-loaded workspaces with sample data and pipelines so you can get hands-on quickly and easily. Including:
  - GWAS
  - Variant caller
  - PIC-SURE
  - Hail
  - Genome Analysis Toolkit
  - And many more...
  - Work in a secure environment: Terra has received Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) Moderate authorization and accreditation, with FedRAMP authorization on the horizon
- Seamlessly collaborate with colleagues by sharing and controlling access to your research assets by designating Reader, Writer, and Owner roles.
- Control your costs: Real-time cost estimates for interactive analysis, and coming soon, actual workflow-level cost reporting. Cost estimates are provided for the showcase pipelines too.
