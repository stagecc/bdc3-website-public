teaser: The Gen3 software stack is a collection of microservices that enable the standing-up of data commons, which allows different partner organizations to pool data and grants approved researchers access to harmonized datasets in a scalable, reproducible, and secure manner.
service: Search and filter harmonized TOPMed variables and their value ranges, and export the selected cohorts to analytical workspaces. Gen3 also allows users to search study-specific genomic and phenotypic data files broken down by consent groups, and discover new studies to apply for access through dbGaP.

- Private, secure, workspaces (projects) for running analyses at scale
- Collaboration features with the ability to set granular permissions on project members
- Direct access to BioData Catalyst without needing to set up a Google or AWS billing account
- Access hosted TOPMed studies all in one place and analyze data on the cloud at scale
- Tools and features for performing multiple-variant and single-variant association studies including:
    + Annotation Explorer for variant aggregations
    + Cloud-optimized Genesis R package workflows in Common Workflow Language
- Cohort creation by searching phenotype data
    + Use PIC-SURE API for searching phenotype data 
    + Search by known dbGaP identifiers
- Perform easy interactive analysis and manipulation of phenotype data using Rstudio and Jupyterlab Notebooks built directly into the platform
- Hosted TOPMed data  you can combine with your own data on AWS or Google Cloud
- Billing and administrative controls to help your research funding go further &mdash; avoid forgotten instances, abort infinite loops, get usage breakdowns by project.
