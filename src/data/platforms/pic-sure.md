teaser: The Patient Information Commons Standard Unification of Research Elements (PIC-SURE) user interface gives  investigators the ability to search available data and conduct feasibility queries, allowing for cohorts to be built in real-time and results to be exported via the PIC-SURE API for analysis.
service: Explore available data through BioData Catalyst Powered by PIC-SURE with interactive search and visualizations for feasibility assessment. Use query results to create a cohort, with the ability to choose specific variables of interest to export into an analysis environment.
---

- Search ALL phenotypic data by typing terms directly in the search bar to find variables of interest across all available studies
- Search available harmonized variables across multiple studies
- Develop and refine cohorts in real-time by building complex queries using multiple variables
- Refine queries by using variable values
- Export full phenotypic datasets to analysis environment with the click of a button
- Export select variables of interest, rather than the full dataset, to an analysis environment
- Use example Jupyter notebooks (R or Python) provided to use the PIC-SURE API to conduct analysis of cohorts created in the PIC-SURE search, available on Seven Bridges and Terra
- Save query identifiers to easily locate past queries in the future
