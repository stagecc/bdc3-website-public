about: <em>BDC-Seven Bridges</em> offers researchers collaborative workspaces for analyzing genomics data at scale. Researchers can find and analyze the hosted TOPMed studies by using hundreds of optimized analysis tools and workflows (pipelines); creating their own workflows; or interactive analysis.
service: Utilize collaborative workspaces for analyzing genomics data at scale. Access hosted datasets along with Common Workflow Language (CWL) and GENESIS R package pipelines for analysis. This platform also enables users to bring their own data for analysis and work in RStudio and Jupyterlab Notebooks for interactive analysis.
