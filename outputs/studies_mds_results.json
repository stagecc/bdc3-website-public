DNA from peripheral blood and phenotypic information were collected from 3,119 adult Samoans, 23 to 70 years of age. The participants reside throughout the independent nation of Samoa, which is experiencing economic development and the nutrition transition. Genotyping was performed with the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array using a panel of approximately 900,000 SNPs. Anthropometric, fasting blood biomarkers and detailed dietary, physical activity, health and socio-demographic variables were collected. We are replicating the GWAS findings in an independent sample of 2,500 Samoans from earlier studies. After replication of genomic regions and informative SNPs in those regions, we will determine sequences of the important genes, and determine the specific genetic variants in the sequenced genes that are associated with adiposity and related cardiometabolic conditions. We will also identify gene by environment interactions, focusing on dietary intake patterns and nutrients.

    "Description": "ECLIPSE was a longitudinal observational study of 2164 COPD subjects and a smaller number of smoking controls (337) and nonsmoking controls (245) followed regularly for three years, with three chest CT scans (at baseline, one year, and three years) (Vestbo, European Respiratory Journal 2008; 31: 869). Inclusion criteria included age 40-75, at least 10 pack-years of smoking, and spirometry in GOLD grades 2-4 (COPD cases) or normal spirometry with post-bronchodilator FEV1 >85% predicted and FEV1/FVC>0.7 (controls). Study visits were performed at enrollment, three months, and every six months thereafter with spirometry, questionnaires, and other clinical evaluations. The ECLIPSE CT scans have been analyzed with the VIDA software for emphysema and airway phenotypes. ECLIPSE has provided key insights into the clinical epidemiology of COPD, including COPD exacerbations (Hurst, NEJM 2010; 363: 1128) and lung function decline in COPD (Vestbo, NEJM 2011; 365: 1184). ECLIPSE has been used in a number of genetic studies of COPD susceptibility and protein biomarkers(Faner, Thorax 2014; 69: 666).

    "Description": "This study aimed to determine whether or not treatment with hydroxyurea titrated to maximum tolerated doses would reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive (painful) crises by at least 50% in 299 men and women between 18 and 50 years old with a diagnosis of sickle cell anemia by gel electrophoresis conducted by a Core Laboratory. A secondary objective investigated correlations of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and other patient or treatment characteristics with the occurrence of vaso-occlusive (painful) crises, and the effect of treatment on the quality of life.This controlled trial made hydroxyurea the first drug of proven benefit in preventing vaso-occlusive pain crisis and acute chest syndrome caused by sickle cell disease, with additional findings including reduced mortality in adult patients taking hydroxyurea for frequent painful sickle cell episodes after 9 of years follow-up. No significant side-effects of hydroxyurea therapy were noted.Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/.

    "Description": "\"This study is part of the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Whole Genome Sequencing Program. TOPMed is part of a broader Precision Medicine Initiative, which aims to provide disease treatments that are tailored to an individual's unique genes and environment. TOPMed will contribute to this initiative through the integration of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other -omics (e.g., metabolic profiles, protein and RNA expression patterns) data with molecular, behavioral, imaging, environmental, and clinical data. In doing so, this program aims to uncover factors that increase or decrease the risk of disease, to identify subtypes of disease, and to develop more targeted and personalized treatments. Two genotype call sets derived from WGS are now available, Freeze 8 (GRCh38) and Freeze 9b (GRCh38), with largely overlapping sample sets. Information about how to identify other TOPMed WGS accessions for cross-study analysis, as well as descriptions of TOPMed methods of data acquisition, data processing and quality control, are provided in the accompanying documents, \"\"TOPMed Whole Genome Sequencing Project - Freeze 8, Phases 1-4\"\" and \"\"TOPMed Whole Genome Sequencing Project - Freeze 9b, Phases 1-4\"\". Please check the study list at the top of each of these methods documents to determine whether it applies to this study accession.Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study Description Subpopulations and intermediate outcome measures in COPD study (SPIROMICS) supports the prospective collection and analysis of phenotypic, biomarker, genetic, genomic, and clinical data from subjects with COPD for the purpose of identifying subpopulations and intermediate outcome measures. It is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and is coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Molecular fingerprinting and extensive subject phenotyping will be performed to identify disease subpopulations and to identify and validate surrogate markers of disease severity, which will be useful as intermediate outcome measures for future clinical trials. Secondary aims are to clarify the natural history of COPD, to develop bioinformatic resources that will enable the utilization and sharing of data in studies of COPD and related diseases, and to create a collection of clinical, biomarker, radiographic, and genetic data that can be used by external investigators for other studies of COPD. Participating Institutions: Research participants for SPIROMICS will be enrolled, phenotyped, and followed at twelve SPIROMICS Clinical Centers: Columbia University, Temple University, Johns Hopkins University, Wake Forest University, University of Michigan, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Iowa, University of Utah, National Jewish Health, University of California at San Francisco, and University of California at Los Angeles. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill serves as the Genomics and Informatics Center. The Radiology Reading Center is based at the University of Iowa. The PFT Reading Center is based at the University of California at Los Angeles. Study Design: SPIROMICS is a prospective cohort study that enrolled approximately 2,981 participants at twelve clinical centers over five years. Participants are distributed across four enrollment strata (i.e., Never-smokers, Smokers without COPD, Mild/Moderate COPD, and Severe COPD). Study Visits: Participants have up to four in-person visits (Baseline and Annual Clinic Visits at years 1, 2, 3 after Baseline). Study questionnaires and spirometry are completed at all main study visits. Blood and urine samples are collected at visits 1, 2, and 4. Sputum samples are collected at Visit 1. The CT scans are completed and Baseline and Visit 2. Participants also receive quarterly follow-up calls to assess health status and determine if an exacerbation has occurred. Substudies  Bronchoscopy and Immunophenotyping Substudy The Bronchoscopy Substudy will enroll 50 subjects per site, for a total of 300 participants. These participants will be recruited across all four study strata. This substudy includes two study visits. During the first visit, sputum samples are collected for Immunophenotyping analysis at the Immunophenotyping Core Lab based at the University of Michigan. Participants then return for a second visit during which samples are collected via bronchoscopy, including bronchoalveolar lavage, epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies. Immunophenotyping analysis is also conducted on BAL and blood collected during the bronchoscopy study visit. Repeatability Substudy The entire baseline clinic visit was repeated on 98 volunteers to determine reliability of measurement procedures. All baseline study-related procedures and questionnaires, including the CT scan, were re-administered and new samples of blood, urine, saliva, and sputum were collected. Field center staff processed these biospecimen samples according to the same protocol. Exacerbation Substudy The Exacerbation Substudy is a prospective, longitudinal observational study of up to 400 participants, which will allow the assessment of participant-driven health care utilization (HCU) events and symptom-defined exacerbation events over time. HCU-driven events are defined by change in medical treatment in response to a perceived COPD Exacerbation. Symptom-based events will be defined by using EXACT-PRO (EXacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool - Patient Reported Outcome), a daily symptom diary developed to measure the frequency, severity, and duration of exacerbations in clinical trials. All participants are provided with a PDA on which to complete the diary. Participants reporting a possible COPD exacerbation will be brought into the study clinic for a study visit to collect biological specimens and questionnaire data.  The overall objectives of the Exacerbation Substudy are to:  Obtain clinical data and specimens on SPIROMICS participants before and during an acute COPD exacerbation defined by  Health care utilization triggered by the subject, or Symptomatic change (triggered by an EXACT defined threshold)   Describe symptomatic changes occurring around HCU and symptom-defined (EXACT) events and their relationship to clinical and specimen data, Characterize the non-exacerbation \"\"stable\"\" state in COPD using the EXACT, including:  Symptom variability (EXACT), Clinical data and specimen parameters during a stable state (baseline), The relationship between clinical and specimen data and symptom severity and variability.   Explore the characteristics of stable patients, defined as those who do not experience HCU or symptom-defined (EXACT) events during the sub-study period, using baseline clinical data and specimens, and compare these characteristics with patients who experience HCU and/or symptom-defined events. Examine the relationship between HCU and symptom-defined exacerbation frequency during the first one-year period of follow-up for exacerbations and health outcomes, including 12-month change in lung function and COPD health status, and longer-term morbidity and mortality, with the latter derived from long-term data from the larger SPIROMICS study.

    "Description": "The Cleveland Family Study (CFS) is a family-based study of sleep apnea, consisting of 2,284 individuals (46% African American) from 361 families studied on up to 4 occasions over a period of 16 years. The study began in 1990 with the initial aims of quantifying the familial aggregation of sleep apnea. National Institutes of Health (NIH) renewals provided expansion of the original cohort, including increased minority recruitment, and longitudinal follow-up, with the last exam occurring in February 2006. The CFS was designed to provide fundamental epidemiological data on risk factors for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). The sample was selected by identifying affected probands who had laboratory diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. All first-degree relatives, spouses and available second-degree relatives of affected probands were studied. In addition, during the first 5 study years, neighborhood control families were identified through a neighborhood proband, and his/her spouses and first-degree relatives. Each exam, occurring at approximately 4-year intervals, included new enrollment as well as follow up exams for previously enrolled subjects. For the first three visits, data, including an overnight sleep study, were collected in participants' homes while the last visit occurred in a general clinical research center (GCRC). Phenotypic characterization of the entire cohort included overnight sleep apnea studies, blood pressure, spirometry, anthropometry and questionnaires. Currently, data of 710 individuals are available for use through BioData Catalyst (with genotype data available through dbGaP).The National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) is a NIH-supported sleep data repository that offers free access to large collections of de-identified physiological signals and related clinical data from a large range of cohort studies, clinical trials and other data sources from children and adults, including healthy individuals from the community and individuals with known sleep or other health disorders.  The goals of NSRR are to facilitate rigorous research that requires access to large or more diverse data sets, including raw physiological signals, to promote a better understanding of risk factors for sleep and circadian disorders and/or the impact of sleep disturbances on health-related outcomes.  Data from over 15 data sources and more than 40,000 individual sleep studies, many linked to dozens if not hundreds of clinical data elements, are available (as of Feb. 2022). Query tools are available to identify variables of interest, and their meta-data and provenance.

    "Description": "\"This study is part of the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)  Whole Genome Sequencing Program. TOPMed is part of a broader  Precision Medicine Initiative,  which aims to provide disease treatments that are tailored to an individual's  unique genes and environment. TOPMed will contribute to this initiative through the  integration of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other -omics (e.g., metabolic profiles,  protein and RNA expression patterns) data with molecular, behavioral, imaging, environmental,  and clinical data. In doing so, this program aims to uncover factors that increase or decrease  the risk of disease, to identify subtypes of disease, and to develop more targeted and personalized  treatments. Two genotype call sets derived from WGS are now available,  Freeze 5b (GRCh38) and Freeze 8 (GRCh38), with largely overlapping sample sets.  Information about how to identify other TOPMed WGS accessions for cross-study analysis,  as well as descriptions of TOPMed methods of data acquisition, data processing and quality control,  are provided in the accompanying documents,   \"\"TOPMed Whole Genome Sequencing Project - Freeze 5b, Phases 1 and 2\"\"  and \"\"TOPMed Whole Genome Sequencing Project - Freeze 8, Phases 1-4\"\".  Please check the study list at the top of each of these methods documents to determine whether  it applies to this study accession. The Cleveland Family Study (CFS) is one cohort involved in the WGS project. The CFS was designed to provide fundamental epidemiological data on genetic and non-genetic risk factors for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). In brief, the CFS is a family-based study that enrolled a total of 2284 individuals from 361 families between 1990 and 2006. The sample was selected by identifying affected probands who had laboratory diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. All first degree relatives, spouses and available second degree relatives of affected probands were studied. In addition, during the first 5 study years, neighborhood control families were identified through a neighborhood proband, and his/her spouses and first degree relatives. Each exam, occurring at approximately 4 year intervals, included new enrollment as well as follow up exams for previously enrolled subjects. For the first three visits, data, including an overnight sleep study, were collected in the participants' homes while the last visit occurred in a general clinical research center (GCRC). Phenotypic characterization of the entire cohort included overnight sleep apnea studies, blood pressure, spirometry, anthropometry and questionnaires. The GCRC exam (n=735 selected individuals) included more comprehensive phenotype data on a focused subsample of the larger cohort, to permit linking SDB phenotypes with cardio-metabolic phenotypes, with an interest in identifying genetic loci that are associated with these related phenotypes. In this last round of data collection, a subset of 735 individuals was selected based on expected genetic informativity by choosing pedigrees where siblings had extremes of the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Participants underwent detailed phenotyping including laboratory polysomnography (PSG), ECG, spirometry, nasal and oral acoustic reflectometry, vigilance testing, and blood and urine collection before and after sleep and after an oral glucose tolerance test. A wide range of biochemical measures of inflammation and metabolism were assayed by a Core Laboratory at the University of Vermont. 994 individuals were sequenced as part of TOPMed Phase 1, including 507 African-Americans and 487 European-Americans. Among the sequenced individuals, 156 were probands with diagnosed sleep apnea, an additional 706 were members of families with probands, and 132 were from neighborhood control families.  298 individuals were sequenced as part of TOPMed Phase 3.5, including 169 African-Americans and 129 European-Americans. Among the newly sequenced individuals, 33 were probands with diagnosed sleep apnea, an additional 214 were members of families with probands, and 51 were from neighborhood control families.

    "Description": "\"See Grouping of Framingham Phenotype Datasets Startup of Framingham Heart Study. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI) -- embarked on a novel and ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic. The objective of the FHS was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. Design of Framingham Heart Study. In 1948, the researchers recruited 5,209 men and women between the ages of 30 and 62 from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, and began the first round of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would later analyze for common patterns related to CVD development. Since 1948, the subjects have returned to the study every two years for an examination consisting of a detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, and in 1971, the study enrolled a second-generation cohort -- 5,124 of the original participants' adult children and their spouses -- to participate in similar examinations. The second examination of the Offspring cohort occurred eight years after the first examination, and subsequent examinations have occurred approximately every four years thereafter. In April 2002 the Study entered a new phase: the enrollment of a third generation of participants, the grandchildren of the original cohort. The first examination of the Third Generation Study was completed in July 2005 and involved 4,095 participants. Thus, the FHS has evolved into a prospective, community-based, three generation family study. The FHS is a joint project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and Boston University. Research Areas in the Framingham Heart Study. Over the years, careful monitoring of the FHS population has led to the identification of the major CVD risk factors -- high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity -- as well as a great deal of valuable information on the effects of related factors such as blood triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, age, gender, and psychosocial issues. Risk factors have been identified for the major components of CVD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, intermittent claudication, and heart failure. It is also clear from research in the FHS and other studies that substantial subclinical vascular disease occurs in the blood vessels, heart and brain that precedes clinical CVD. With recent advances in technology, the FHS has enhanced its research capabilities and capitalized on its inherent resources by the conduct of high resolution imaging to detect and quantify subclinical vascular disease in the major blood vessels, heart and brain. These studies have included ultrasound studies of the heart (echocardiography) and carotid arteries, computed tomography studies of the heart and aorta, and magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain, heart, and aorta. Although the Framingham cohort is primarily white, the importance of the major CVD risk factors identified in this group have been shown in other studies to apply almost universally among racial and ethnic groups, even though the patterns of distribution may vary from group to group. In the past half century, the Study has produced approximately 1,200 articles in leading medical journals. The concept of CVD risk factors has become an integral part of the modern medical curriculum and has led to the development of effective treatment and preventive strategies in clinical practice. In addition to research studies focused on risk factors, subclinical CVD and clinically apparent CVD, Framingham investigators have also collaborated with leading researchers from around the country and throughout the world on projects involving some of the major chronic illnesses in men and women, including dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis, nutritional deficiencies, eye diseases, hearing disorders, and chronic obstructive lung diseases. Genetic Research in the Framingham Heart Study. While pursuing the Study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators has expanded its research mission into the study of genetic factors underlying CVD and other disorders. Over the past two decades, DNA has been collected from blood samples and from immortalized cell lines obtained from Original Cohort participants, members of the Offspring Cohort and the Third Generation Cohort. Several large-scale genotyping projects have been conducted in the past decade. Genome-wide linkage analysis has been conducted using genotypes of approximately 400 microsatellite markers that have been completed in over 9,300 subjects in all three generations. Analyses using microsatellite markers completed in the original cohort and offspring cohorts have resulted in over 100 publications, including many publications from the Genetics Analysis Workshop 13. Several other recent collaborative projects have completed thousands of SNP genotypes for candidate gene regions in subsets of FHS subjects with available DNA. These projects include the Cardiogenomics Program of the NHLBI's Programs for Genomics Applications, the genotyping of ~3000 SNPs in inflammation genes, and the completion of a genome-wide scan of 100,000 SNPs using the Affymetrix 100K Genechip. Framingham Cohort Phenotype Data. The phenotype database contains a vast array of phenotype information available in all three generations. These will include the quantitative measures of the major risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, and cigarette use, as well as anthropomorphic measures such as body mass index, biomarkers such as fibrinogen and CRP, and electrocardiography measures such as the QT interval. Many of these measures have been collected repeatedly in the original and offspring cohorts. Also included in the SHARe database will be an array of recently collected biomarkers, subclinical disease imaging measures, clinical CVD outcomes as well as an array of ancillary studies. The phenotype data is located here in the top-level study phs000007 Framingham Cohort.

For decades, the FHS has made its data and DNA widely available to qualified investigators throughout the world through the Limited Access Datasets and the FHS DNA Committee, and the SHARe database will continue that tradition by allowing access to qualified investigators who agree to the requirements of data access. With the SHARe database, we continue with an ambitious research agenda and look forward to new discoveries in the decades to come.

    "Description": "\"The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. The original WHI study included 161,808 postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA serves as the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center for data collection, management, and analysis of the WHI. The WHI has two major parts: a partial factorial randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS); both were conducted at 40 Clinical Centers nationwide. The CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:  Hormone Therapy Trials (HT): This double-blind component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component with an intact uterus were randomized to estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE], 0.625 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] 2.5 mg/d] or a matching placebo. Women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to CEE or placebo. Both trials were stopped early, in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively, based on adverse effects. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out. Dietary Modification Trial (DM): The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants were randomized to either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern. Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD): This double-blind component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component were randomized to calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D (400 IU/d) supplements or a matching placebo.   The Observational Study (OS) examines the relationship between lifestyle, environmental, medical and molecular risk factors and specific measures of health or disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women not participating in the CT. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed annually for 8 to 12 years. Extension Studies: The original protocol allowed for follow-up until March 2005, after which participants were invited to enroll in the first WHI Extension Study for follow-up through 2010. Participants were invited again to participate in the second WHI Extension Study with continued follow up from 2010 to at least 2015. As of March 31, 2011 there were 93,122 women enrolled in the second extension. In Extension Study 2, the overall WHI study population was divided into two new subsamples, the Medical Records Cohort (MRC) and the Self-Report Cohort (SRC). The MRC consists of all former hormone trial participants and all African American and Hispanic participants from all study components. The SRC consists of the remaining participants. The extent of outcome information collected differs between the two cohorts, with more extensive outcomes information collection on the MRC. As part of Extension Study 2, selected older WHI participants were invited to participate in an In Person Visit (a.k.a., Long Life Study) at their homes during which additional blood samples were collected and various measurements were taken (such as blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, grip strength, etc.). In October 2015, Extension Study 2 was renewed with continued follow-up planned through October 2020, pending annual contract review and renewal.

    "Description": "\"The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is a large, community-based, observational study whose participants were recruited from urban and rural areas of the three counties (Hinds, Madison and Rankin) that make up the Jackson, MS metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Participants were enrolled from each of 4 recruitment pools: random, 17%; volunteer, 30%; currently enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, 31% and secondary family members, 22%. The final cohort of 5,306 participants included 6.59% of all African American Jackson MSA residents aged 35-84 during the baseline exam (N-76,426, US Census 2000). Among these, approximately 3,600 gave consent that allows genetic research and deposition of data into dbGaP. Major components of three clinic examinations (Exam 1 - 2000-2004; Exam 2 - 2005-2008; Exam 3 - 2009-2013) include medical history, physical examination, blood/urine analytes and interview questions on areas such as: physical activity; stress, coping and spirituality; racism and discrimination; socioeconomic position; and access to health care. Extensive clinical phenotyping includes anthropometrics, electrocardiography, carotid ultrasound, ankle-brachial blood pressure index, echocardiography, CT chest and abdomen for coronary and aortic calcification, liver fat, and subcutaneous and visceral fat measurement, and cardiac MRI. At 12-month intervals after the baseline clinic visit (Exam 1), participants have been contacted by telephone to: update information; confirm vital statistics; document interim medical events, hospitalizations, and functional status; and obtain additional sociocultural information. Questions about medical events, symptoms of cardiovascular disease and functional status are repeated annually. Ongoing cohort surveillance includes abstraction of medical records and death certificates for relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and adjudication of nonfatal events and deaths. CMS data are currently being incorporated into the dataset. A note regarding date variables warehoused in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) Cohort on dbGaP: The coordinating center has developed an algorithm that will systematically review and de-identify any of the (nearly 100) date-related variable types stored in the data package. To simultaneously minimize (i) de-identifiability of the data and (ii) impact on analyses utilizing sensitive data elements, a participant-level random number was generated to avoid the necessity of sharing any potentially sensitive data. The coordinating center maintains an archived linkage of these data in their raw form and regularly reviews ad hoc requests to utilize the raw data on a project-by-project basis.

    "Description": "\"The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is a prospective epidemiologic study conducted in four U.S. communities. The four communities are Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; the northwest suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. ARIC is designed to investigate the etiology and natural history of atherosclerosis, the etiology of clinical atherosclerotic diseases, and variation in cardiovascular risk factors, medical care and disease by race, gender, location, and date. ARIC includes two parts: the Cohort Component and the Community Surveillance Component. The Cohort Component began in 1987, and each ARIC field center randomly selected and recruited a cohort sample of approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 from a defined population in their community. A total of 15,792 participants received an extensive examination, including medical, social, and demographic data. These participants were examined with the baseline visit occurring in 1987-89, the second visit in 1990-92, the third visit in 1993-95, the fourth visit in 1996-98, and the fifth visit in 2011-13. Follow-up occurs yearly by telephone to maintain contact with participants and to assess health status of the cohort.  In the Community Surveillance Component, these four communities were investigated to determine the community-wide occurrence of hospitalized myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease deaths in men and women aged 35-84 years. Hospitalized stroke is investigated in cohort participants only. Starting in 2006, the study conducted community surveillance of inpatient (ages 55 years and older) and outpatient heart failure (ages 65 years and older) for heart failure events beginning in 2005. Community Surveillance for non-cohorts ended in event year 2014. ARIC is currently funded through October 31, 2021. The ARIC Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP sub-studies.

    "Description": "\"See Grouping of Framingham Phenotype Datasets Startup of Framingham Heart Study. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI) -- embarked on a novel and ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic. The objective of the FHS was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. Design of Framingham Heart Study. In 1948, the researchers recruited 5,209 men and women between the ages of 30 and 62 from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, and began the first round of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would later analyze for common patterns related to CVD development. Since 1948, the subjects have returned to the study every two years for an examination consisting of a detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, and in 1971, the study enrolled a second-generation cohort -- 5,124 of the original participants' adult children and their spouses -- to participate in similar examinations. The second examination of the Offspring cohort occurred eight years after the first examination, and subsequent examinations have occurred approximately every four years thereafter. In April 2002 the Study entered a new phase: the enrollment of a third generation of participants, the grandchildren of the original cohort. The first examination of the Third Generation Study was completed in July 2005 and involved 4,095 participants. Thus, the FHS has evolved into a prospective, community-based, three generation family study. The FHS is a joint project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and Boston University. Research Areas in the Framingham Heart Study. Over the years, careful monitoring of the FHS population has led to the identification of the major CVD risk factors -- high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity -- as well as a great deal of valuable information on the effects of related factors such as blood triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, age, gender, and psychosocial issues. Risk factors have been identified for the major components of CVD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, intermittent claudication, and heart failure. It is also clear from research in the FHS and other studies that substantial subclinical vascular disease occurs in the blood vessels, heart and brain that precedes clinical CVD. With recent advances in technology, the FHS has enhanced its research capabilities and capitalized on its inherent resources by the conduct of high resolution imaging to detect and quantify subclinical vascular disease in the major blood vessels, heart and brain. These studies have included ultrasound studies of the heart (echocardiography) and carotid arteries, computed tomography studies of the heart and aorta, and magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain, heart, and aorta. Although the Framingham cohort is primarily white, the importance of the major CVD risk factors identified in this group have been shown in other studies to apply almost universally among racial and ethnic groups, even though the patterns of distribution may vary from group to group. In the past half century, the Study has produced approximately 1,200 articles in leading medical journals. The concept of CVD risk factors has become an integral part of the modern medical curriculum and has led to the development of effective treatment and preventive strategies in clinical practice. In addition to research studies focused on risk factors, subclinical CVD and clinically apparent CVD, Framingham investigators have also collaborated with leading researchers from around the country and throughout the world on projects involving some of the major chronic illnesses in men and women, including dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis, nutritional deficiencies, eye diseases, hearing disorders, and chronic obstructive lung diseases. Genetic Research in the Framingham Heart Study. While pursuing the Study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators has expanded its research mission into the study of genetic factors underlying CVD and other disorders. Over the past two decades, DNA has been collected from blood samples and from immortalized cell lines obtained from Original Cohort participants, members of the Offspring Cohort and the Third Generation Cohort. Several large-scale genotyping projects have been conducted in the past decade. Genome-wide linkage analysis has been conducted using genotypes of approximately 400 microsatellite markers that have been completed in over 9,300 subjects in all three generations. Analyses using microsatellite markers completed in the original cohort and offspring cohorts have resulted in over 100 publications, including many publications from the Genetics Analysis Workshop 13. Several other recent collaborative projects have completed thousands of SNP genotypes for candidate gene regions in subsets of FHS subjects with available DNA. These projects include the Cardiogenomics Program of the NHLBI's Programs for Genomics Applications, the genotyping of ~3000 SNPs in inflammation genes, and the completion of a genome-wide scan of 100,000 SNPs using the Affymetrix 100K Genechip. Framingham Cohort Phenotype Data. The phenotype database contains a vast array of phenotype information available in all three generations. These will include the quantitative measures of the major risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, and cigarette use, as well as anthropomorphic measures such as body mass index, biomarkers such as fibrinogen and CRP, and electrocardiography measures such as the QT interval. Many of these measures have been collected repeatedly in the original and offspring cohorts. Also included in the SHARe database will be an array of recently collected biomarkers, subclinical disease imaging measures, clinical CVD outcomes as well as an array of ancillary studies. The phenotype data is located here in the top-level study phs000007 Framingham Cohort.

For decades, the FHS has made its data and DNA widely available to qualified investigators throughout the world through the Limited Access Datasets and the FHS DNA Committee, and the SHARe database will continue that tradition by allowing access to qualified investigators who agree to the requirements of data access. With the SHARe database, we continue with an ambitious research agenda and look forward to new discoveries in the decades to come.

    "Description": "\"MESA The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a study of the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease (disease detected non-invasively before it has produced clinical signs and symptoms) and the risk factors that predict progression to clinically overt cardiovascular disease or progression of the subclinical disease. MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent. Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam and determination of coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality. In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by four examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality. MESA Family The general goal of the MESA Family Study, an ancillary study to MESA funded by a grant from NHLBI, is to apply modern genetic analysis and genotyping methodologies to delineate the genetic determinants of early atherosclerosis. This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia. In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations. In a small proportion of subjects, parents of MESA index subjects participating in MESA Family were studied but only to have blood drawn for genotyping. The MESA Family cohort was recruited from the six MESA Field Centers. MESA Family participants underwent the same examination as MESA participants during May 2004 - May 2007. DNA was extracted and lymphocytes immortalized for study of candidate genes, genome-wide linkage scanning, and analyzed for linkage with these subclinical cardiovascular traits. While linkage analysis is the primary approach being used, an additional aspect of the MESA Family Study takes advantage of the existing MESA study population for testing a variety of candidate genes for association with the same subclinical traits. Genotyping and data analysis will occur throughout the study. MESA Air The general goal of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution ('MESA Air') is to prospectively examine the relation between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures (including PM2.5 and the progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease in a multi-city, multi-ethnic cohort. MESA Air will also prospectively examine the relationship between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures and the incidence of cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. MESA AIR is funded by a grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to the University of Washington and subcontracts from the UW to other participating institutions. MESA Air will assess if ambient air pollution is associated with changes over time in subclinical measures of atherosclerosis and plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial activation in a longitudinal data model, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and specific cardiovascular risk factors (such as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and diet). The study will similarly assess if the incidence of cardiovascular events is associated with long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, using a proportional hazards model. The study includes refinement of statistical tools, and explores joint/independent effects of acute and long-term pollutant exposure in the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. The MESA Air study is built on the foundation of the ongoing MESA study. The parent MESA Study cohort is located in six geographic areas ('Field Centers') that capture tremendous exposure heterogeneity, comparable to or greater than the variability in locations of prior U.S. cohort studies. In addition to the six Field Centers, the study involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), ultrasound and air pollution data. The cohort for the MESA Air study currently includes 6226 subjects: 5479 enrolled in the parent MESA study; 257 recruited specifically for this study, and 490 recruited from the MESA Family study. The entire MESA Air cohort will be followed over a 10-year project period for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events. On two occasions over the ten-year study period, 3600 subjects from the MESA Air cohort, residing in nine locales, will undergo computed tomography scanning to assess presence and extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC), and ultrasound of the carotid artery to determine intima-media thickness (IMT). We will also repeatedly assess plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial function in 720 subjects. MESA Air adds state-of-the-art air pollution exposure assessment information to the MESA cohort study, and introduces new subjects and outcome measures to achieve our aims. The study will assess long-term individual-level exposure to ambient air pollutants for each subject using community-scale monitoring, outdoor spatial variation, subject proximity to pollution sources, pollutants' infiltration efficiency, and personal time-activity information. The exposure models will be validated using detailed monitoring in a subset of subjects. The MESA Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP substudies.

    "Description": "\"Overview: Our overall long-term goal is to determine risk factors for the complex (multifactorial) disease, venous thromboembolism (VTE), that will allow physicians to stratify individual patient risk and target VTE prophylaxis to those who would benefit most. In this genome-wide association case-control study (1300 cases and 1300 controls) we hope to identify susceptibility variants for VTE. Mutations within genes encoding for important components of the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic, and innate immunity pathways are risk factors for VTE. We hypothesize that other genes within these four pathways or within other pathways also are VTE disease-susceptibility genes. Therefore, we performed a genome wide association (GWA) screen and analysis using the Illumina 660W platform to identify SNPs within 1,300 clinic-based, non-cancer VTE cases primarily from Minnesota and the upper Midwest USA, and 1300 clinic-based, unrelated controls frequency-matched on patient age, gender, myocardial infarction/stroke status and state of residence. This is a subset of a slightly larger candidate gene study using 1500 case-control pairs to identify haplotype-tagging SNPs (ht-SNPs) in a large set of candidate genes (n~750) within the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic, and innate immunity pathways. Study Populations. Cases. VTE cases were consecutive Mayo Clinic outpatients with objectively-diagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) residing in the upper Midwest and referred by Mayo Clinic physician to the Mayo Clinic Special Coagulation Laboratory for clinical diagnostic testing to evaluate for an acquired or inherited thrombophilia, or to the Mayo Clinic Thrombophilia Center. Any person contacted to be a control but discovered to have had a VTE was evaluated for inclusion as a case. Cases were primarily residents from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, North or South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Indiana. A DVT or PE was categorized as objectively diagnosed when (a) confirmed by venography or pulmonary angiography, or pathology examination of thrombus removed at surgery, or (b) if at least one non-invasive test (compression duplex ultrasonography, lung scan, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging) was positive. A VTE was defined as:  Proximal leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which includes the common iliac, internal iliac, external iliac, common femoral, superficial [now termed \"\"femoral\"\"] femoral, deep femoral [sometimes referred to as \"\"profunda\"\" femoral] and/or popliteal veins. (Note: greater and lesser saphenous veins, or other superficial or perforator veins, were not included as proximal or distal leg DVT). Distal leg DVT (or \"\"isolated calf DVT\"\"), which includes the anterior tibial, posterior tibial and/or peroneal veins. (Note: gastrocnemius, soleal and/or sural [e.g., \"\"deep muscular veins\"\" of the calf] vein thrombosis was not included as distal leg DVT). Arm DVT, which includes the axillary, subclavian and/or innominate (brachiocephalic) veins.

Cerebral vein thrombosis (includes cerebral or dural sinus or vein, saggital sinus or vein, and/or transverse sinus or vein thrombosis). Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis Superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis Pulmonary embolism   Patients with VTE related to active cancer, antiphospholipid syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis, a rheumatoid or other autoimmune disorder, a vascular anomaly (e.g., Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome, etc.), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or a mechanical cause for DVT (e.g., arm DVT or SVC thrombosis related to a central venous catheter or transvenous pacemaker, portal and/or splenic vein thrombosis related to liver cirrhosis, IVC thrombosis related to retroperitoneal fibrosis, etc.), with hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, or with prior liver or bone marrow transplantation were excluded.  Controls. A Mayo Clinic outpatient control group was prospectively recruited for this study. Controls were frequency-matched on the age group (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80+ years), sex, myocardial infarction/stroke status, and state of residence distribution of the cases. We selected clinic-based controls using a controls' database of persons undergoing general medical examinations in the Mayo Clinic Departments of General Internal Medicine or Primary Care Internal Medicine. Additionally persons undergoing evaluation at the Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center, and the Department of Family Medicine were screened for inclusion as controls. This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, http://www.genevastudy.org) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to venous thrombosis through large-scale genome-wide association studies of 1,300 clinic-based, VTE cases and 1300 clinic-based, unrelated controls. Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.

    "Description": "\"The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is a prospective epidemiologic study conducted in four U.S. communities. The four communities are Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; the northwest suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. ARIC is designed to investigate the etiology and natural history of atherosclerosis, the etiology of clinical atherosclerotic diseases, and variation in cardiovascular risk factors, medical care and disease by race, gender, location, and date. ARIC includes two parts: the Cohort Component and the Community Surveillance Component. The Cohort Component began in 1987, and each ARIC field center randomly selected and recruited a cohort sample of approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 from a defined population in their community. A total of 15,792 participants received an extensive examination, including medical, social, and demographic data. These participants were examined with the baseline visit occurring in 1987-89, the second visit in 1990-92, the third visit in 1993-95, the fourth visit in 1996-98, and the fifth visit in 2011-13. Follow-up occurs yearly by telephone to maintain contact with participants and to assess health status of the cohort.  In the Community Surveillance Component, these four communities were investigated to determine the community-wide occurrence of hospitalized myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease deaths in men and women aged 35-84 years. Hospitalized stroke is investigated in cohort participants only. Starting in 2006, the study conducted community surveillance of inpatient (ages 55 years and older) and outpatient heart failure (ages 65 years and older) for heart failure events beginning in 2005. Community Surveillance for non-cohorts ended in event year 2014. ARIC is currently funded through October 31, 2021. The ARIC Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP sub-studies.

In 1985-1986, a cohort of 5115 healthy black and white men and women aged 18-30 years were selected to have approximately the same number of people in subgroups of age (18-24 and 25-30), sex, race, and education (high school or less and more than high school) within each of four US Field Centers. These same participants were asked to participate in follow-up examinations during 1987-1988 (Year 2), 1990-1991 (Year 5), 1992-1993 (Year 7), 1995-1996 (Year 10), 2000-2001 (Year 15), 2005-2006 (Year 20), and 2010-2011 (Year 25); the proportions of the surviving cohort that have returned for the seven follow-up examinations were 90%, 86%, 81%, 79%, 74%, 72%, and 72%, respectively. In addition to the follow-up examinations, participants are contacted regularly for the ascertainment of information on out-patient procedures and hospitalizations experienced between contacts. Within the past five years, 95% of the original surviving cohort has been contacted. While the specifics of each examination has differed somewhat, data have been collected on a variety of factors believed to be related to heart disease. These include conditions with clear links to heart disease such as blood pressure, cholesterol and other lipids. Data have also been collected on physical measurements such as weight and skinfold fat as well as lifestyle factors such as substance use (tobacco and alcohol), dietary and exercise patterns, behavioral and psychological variables, medical and family history, and other chemistries (e.g., insulin and glucose). In addition, subclinical atherosclerosis was measured via echocardiography during Years 5, 10, and 25, computed tomography during Years 15 and 20, and carotid ultrasound during Year 20.

    "Name": "NHLBI Cleveland Family Study (CFS) Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe)",
    "Description": "The Cleveland Family Study is the largest family-based study of sleep apnea world-wide, consisting of 2284 individuals (46% African American) from 361 families studied on up to 4 occasions over a period of 16 years. The study was begun in 1990 with the initial aims of quantifying the familial aggregation of sleep apnea. NIH renewals provided expansion of the original cohort (including increased minority recruitment) and longitudinal follow-up, with the last exam occurring in February 2006. Index probands (n=275) were recruited from 3 area hospital sleep labs if they had a confirmed diagnosis of sleep apnea and at least 2 first-degree relatives available to be studied. In the first 5 years of the study, neighborhood control probands (n=87) with at least 2 living relatives available for study were selected at random from a list provided by the index family and also studied. All available first degree relatives and spouses of the case and control probands also were recruited. Second-degree relatives, including half-sibs, aunts, uncles and grandparents, were also included if they lived near the first degree relatives (cases or controls), or if the family had been found to have two or more relatives with sleep apnea. Blood was sampled and DNA isolated for participants seen in the last two exam cycles (n=1447). The sample, which is enriched with individuals with sleep apnea, also contains a high prevalence of individuals with sleep apnea-related traits, including: obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and HTN. Phenotyping data have been collected over 4 exam cycles, each occurring ~every 4 years. The last three exams targeted all subjects who had been studied at earlier exams, as well as new minority families and family members of previously studied probands who had been unavailable at prior exams. Data from one, two, three and four visits are available for 412, 630, 329 and 67, participants, respectively. In the first 3 exams, participants underwent overnight in-home sleep studies, allowing determination of the number and duration of hypopneas and apneas, sleep period, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels; anthropometry (weight, height, and waist, hip, and neck circumferences); resting blood pressure; spirometry; standardized questionnaire evaluation of symptoms, medications, sleep patterns, quality of life, daytime sleepiness measures and health history; venipuncture and measurement of total and HDL cholesterol. The 4th exam (2001-2006) was designed to collect more detailed measurements of sleep, metabolic and CVD phenotypes and included measurement of state-of-the-art polysomnography, with both collection of blood and measurement of blood pressure before and after sleep, and anthropometry, upper airway assessments, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide, and ECG performed the morning after the sleep study. Data have been collected by trained research assistants or GCRC nurses following written Manuals of Procedures who were certified following standard approaches for each study procedure. Ongoing data quality, with assessment of within or between individual drift, has been monitored on an ongoing basis, using statistical techniques as well as regular re-certification procedures. Between and within scorer reliabilities for key sleep apnea indices have been excellent, with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) exceeding 0.92 for the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Sleep staging, assessed with epoch specific comparisons, also demonstrate excellent reliability for stage identification (kappas>0.82). There has been no evidence of significant time trends-between or within scorers- for the AHI variables. We also have evaluated the night-to-night variability of the AHI and other sleep variables in 91 subjects, with each measurement made 1-3 months apart. There is high night to night consistency for the AHI (ICC: 0.80), the arousal index (0.76), and the % sleep time in slow-wave sleep (0.73). We have demonstrated the comparability of the apnea estimates (AHI) determined from limited channel studies obtained at in-home settings with in full in-laboratory polysomnography. In addition to our published validation study, we more recently compared the AHI in 169 Cleveland Family Study participants undergoing both assessments (in-home and in-laboratory) within one week apart. These showed excellent levels of agreement (ICC=0.83), demonstrating the feasibility of examining data from either in-home or in-laboratory studies for apnea phenotyping. Data collected in the GCRC were obtained, when possible, with comparable, if not identical techniques, as were the same measures collected at prior exams performed in the participants' homes. To address the comparability of data collected over different exams, we calculated the crude age-adjusted correlations ~3 year within individual correlations between measures made in the most recent GCRC exam with measures made in a prior exam and demonstrated excellent levels of agreement for BMI (r=.91); waist circumference (0.91); FVC (0.88); and FEV1 (0.86). As expected due to higher biological and measurement variability, 149 somewhat lower 3-year correlations were demonstrated for SBP (0.56); Diastolic BP (0.48); AHI (0.62); and nocturnal oxygen desaturation (0.60). NHLBI Candidate-gene Association Resource. The NHLBI initiated the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) to create a shared genotype/phenotype resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. The resource comprises nine cohort studies funded by the NHLBI: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Cleveland Family Study (CFS), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). A database of genotype and phenotype data will be created that includes records for approximately 50,000 study participants with approximately 50,000 SNPs from more than 1,200 selected candidate genes. In addition, a genome wide association study using a 1,000K SNP Chip will be conducted on approximately 9,500 African American participants drawn from the 50,000 participants in the nine cohorts.

    "Description": "\"The NHLBI \"\"Grand Opportunity\"\" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the \"\"exome\"\") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO. The exome sequencing asthma project includes 200 African-Americans with asthma from the NHLBI multicenter Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). SARP participants were recruited at the NHLBI SARP sites with an emphasis on recruiting severe asthmatics (Moore et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2010. PMID: 19892860). Asthma status was based on both a physician's diagnosis and either bronchodilator reversibility or hyper-responsiveness to methacholine as well as less than 5 pack years of smoking. All subjects were carefully characterized using the standardized SARP protocol which included spirometry (medication withheld), maximum bronchodilator reversibility, hyper-responsiveness to methacholine (not performed in subjects with low baseline FEV1), skin-tests to common allergens, questionnaires on health care utilization and medication use and sputum, lung imaging and bronchoscopy in a subset. In addition GWAS data are available (phs000355, Illumina platform).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, and the only leading cause of death that is steadily increasing in frequency. This project established a racially diverse cohort that is sufficiently large and appropriately designed for genome-wide association analysis of COPD. A total of 10,720 subjects were recruited, including control smokers and nonsmokers, definite COPD cases (GOLD Stage 2 to 4), and subjects not included in either group (GOLD 1 and PRISm). This cohort is being used for cross-sectional analysis, and long-term longitudinal follow-up visits after five years and after ten years are also being performed. The primary focus of the study is to identify the genetic risk factors that determine susceptibility for COPD and COPD-related phenotypes. Detailed phenotyping of both cases and controls, including chest CT scan assessment of emphysema and airway disease, will allow identification of genetic determinants for the heterogeneous components of the COPD syndrome. The aims for this study are:  Precise phenotypic characterization of COPD subjects using computed tomography, as well as clinical and physiological measures, that will provide data to enable the broad COPD syndrome to be decomposed into clinically significant subtype; Genome-wide association studies will identify genetic determinants for COPD susceptibility that will provide insight into clinically relevant COPD subtypes; Distinct genetic determinants influence the development of emphysema and airway disease. The TOPMed analysis will include approximately 10,500 subjects with whole genome sequencing after quality control is completed.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the only leading cause of death that is steadily increasing in frequency. This project collected a set of extended pedigrees ascertained through subjects with severe, early-onset COPD. This study has enrolled subjects with severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) < 40% predicted) at an early age (< 53 years) without alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (a known Mendelian risk factor for COPD). Extended pedigrees are enrolled, primarily in New England, although some more geographically distant subjects have been included.

The Amish Complex Disease Research Program includes a set of large community-based studies focused largely on cardiometabolic health carried out in the Old Order Amish (OOA) community of Lancaster, Pennsylvania (http://medschool.umaryland.edu/endocrinology/amish/research-program.asp). The OOA population of Lancaster County, PA immigrated to the Colonies from Western Europe in the early 1700's. There are now over 30,000 OOA individuals in the Lancaster area, nearly all of whom can trace their ancestry back 12-14 generations to approximately 700 founders. Investigators at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have been studying the genetic determinants of cardiometabolic health in this population since 1993. To date, over 7,000 Amish adults have participated in one or more of our studies. Due to their ancestral history, the OOA may be enriched for rare variants that arose in the population from a single founder (or small number of founders) and propagated through genetic drift. Many of these variants have large effect sizes and identifying them can lead to new biological insights about health and disease. The parent study for this WGS project provides one (of multiple) examples. In our parent study, we identified through a genome-wide association analysis a haplotype that was highly enriched in the OOA that is associated with very high LDL-cholesterol levels. At the present time, the identity of the causative SNP - and even the implicated gene - is not known because the associated haplotype contains numerous genes, none of which are obvious lipid candidate genes. A major goal of the WGS that will be obtained through the NHLBI TOPMed Consortium will be to identify functional variants that underlie some of the large effect associations observed in this unique population.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, and the only leading cause of death that is steadily increasing in frequency. This project established a racially diverse cohort that is sufficiently large and appropriately designed for genome-wide association analysis of COPD. A total of 10,720 subjects were recruited, including control smokers and nonsmokers, definite COPD cases (GOLD Stage 2 to 4), and subjects not included in either group (GOLD 1 and PRISm). This cohort is being used for cross-sectional analysis, and long-term longitudinal follow-up visits after five years and after ten years are also being performed. The primary focus of the study is to identify the genetic risk factors that determine susceptibility for COPD and COPD-related phenotypes. Detailed phenotyping of both cases and controls, including chest CT scan assessment of emphysema and airway disease, will allow identification of genetic determinants for the heterogeneous components of the COPD syndrome. The aims for this study are:  Precise phenotypic characterization of COPD subjects using computed tomography, as well as clinical and physiological measures, that will provide data to enable the broad COPD syndrome to be decomposed into clinically significant subtype; Genome-wide association studies will identify genetic determinants for COPD susceptibility that will provide insight into clinically relevant COPD subtypes; Distinct genetic determinants influence the development of emphysema and airway disease. The TOPMed analysis will include approximately 10,500 subjects with whole genome sequencing after quality control is completed.  Comprehensive phenotypic data for COPDGene subjects is available through dbGaP study phs000179.

Since there is a greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease among African Americans, the purpose of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is to explore the reasons for this disparity and to uncover new approaches to reduce it. The JHS is a large, community-based, observational study whose 5306 participants were recruited from among the non-institutionalized African-American adults from urban and rural areas of the three counties (Hinds, Madison, and Rankin) that make up the Jackson, MS, metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Jackson is the capital of Mississippi, the state with the largest percentage (36.3%) of African Americans in the United States. The JHS design included participants from the Jackson ARIC study who had originally been recruited through random selection from a drivers' license registry. Approximately six months before the JHS was to begin, an amendment to the federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act was passed that changed the level of consent for public release of personal information from driver's license lists from an \"\"opt out\"\" to an \"\"opt in\"\" basis. The Mississippi Highway Patrol was no longer able to release a complete listing of all persons with driver's licenses or state identification cards, which prevented its use in the JHS. New JHS participants were chosen randomly from the Accudata America commercial listing, which provides householder name, address, zip code, phone number (if available), age group in decades, and family components. The Accudata list was deemed to provide the most complete count of households for individuals aged 55 years and older in the Jackson MSA. A structured volunteer sample was also included in which demographic cells for recruitment were designed to mirror the eligible population. Enrollment was opened to volunteers who met census-derived age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES) eligibility criteria for the Jackson MSA. In addition, a family component was included in the JHS. The sampling frame for the family study was a participant in any one of the ARlC, random, or volunteer samples whose family size met eligibility requirements. Eligibility included having at least two full siblings and four first degree relatives (parents, siblings, children over the age of 21) who lived in the Jackson MSA and who were willing to participate in the study. No upper age limit was placed on the family sample. Known contact information was obtained during the baseline clinic examination from the index family member with a verbal pedigree format to identify name(s), age(s), address (es), and telephone number(s). Recruitment was limited to persons 35-84 years old except in the family cohort, where those 21 years old and above were eligible.

    "Description": "\"This study is part of the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)  Whole Genome Sequencing Program. TOPMed is part of a broader  Precision Medicine Initiative,  which aims to provide disease treatments that are tailored to an individual's  unique genes and environment. TOPMed will contribute to this initiative through the  integration of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other -omics (e.g., metabolic profiles,  protein and RNA expression patterns) data with molecular, behavioral, imaging, environmental,  and clinical data. In doing so, this program aims to uncover factors that increase or decrease  the risk of disease, to identify subtypes of disease, and to develop more targeted and personalized  treatments. Two genotype call sets derived from WGS are now available,  Freeze 5b (GRCh38) and Freeze 8 (GRCh38), with largely overlapping sample sets.  Information about how to identify other TOPMed WGS accessions for cross-study analysis,  as well as descriptions of TOPMed methods of data acquisition, data processing and quality control,  are provided in the accompanying documents,   \"\"TOPMed Whole Genome Sequencing Project - Freeze 5b, Phases 1 and 2\"\"  and \"\"TOPMed Whole Genome Sequencing Project - Freeze 8, Phases 1-4\"\".  Please check the study list at the top of each of these methods documents to determine whether  it applies to this study accession. This administrative supplement to the project, \"\"The Genetic Epidemiology of Asthma in Costa Rica\"\" (R37 HL066289) is in response to NOT-HL-14-029 to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) on existing NHLBI populations. We focus on asthma because of its public health significance. Asthma affects 26 million U.S. children and adults, remains a major cause of morbidity (one-half million hospitalizations a year) and is the most common cause of school and work days lost. Asthma-related costs are estimated to be over $12.7 billion annually. The Asthma Probands for both the extended pedigrees and the trios utilized in this study were selected on the basis of a physician diagnosis of asthma; a history of recurrent asthma attacks or at least 2 respiratory symptoms; and either airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine or significant response to bronchodilator (Albuterol) administration. These criteria are identical to the criteria used in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP). The three primary goals of this project are to: (1) identify common and rare genetic variants that determine asthma and its associated phenotypes (height, weight, IgE level, lung function, bronchodilator response, steroid treatment response) through whole genome sequencing (WGS); (2) perform novel family based association analysis of our WGS data to identify novel genes for asthma; and (3) integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data with our WGS data and determine the epistatic interactions present using systems genomics approaches. Identification of the molecular determinants of asthma remains an important priority in translational science. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in this regard, identifying at least 10 novel susceptibility genes for asthma. However, as with most complex traits, the variants identified by GWAS explain only a fraction of the estimated heritability of this disorder. Herein, we propose a novel family-based study design and state-of-the-art genome sequencing techniques to map a set of sequence variants for asthma and its associated phenotypes and assess the interrelationships of the identified genes and variants using systems genomics methods. We have assembled a team of investigators highly-skilled and expert in whole genome sequencing (Drs. Michael Cho and Benjamin Raby), genetic association analysis (Drs. Scott T. Weiss, Jessica Lasky-Su and Christoph Lange), integrative genomics (Drs. Raby, Kelan Tantisira, Augusto Litonjua and Dawn DeMeo), and systems genomics (Drs. Weiss, Amitabh Sharma, Lange and Raby) to address this important problem with both a novel study design and data set.

Objectives The Heart and Vascular Health Study (HVH) is a case-control study of risk factors for the development of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, venous thrombosis (VT), and atrial fibrillation (AF). The study setting is Group Health, an integrated health care delivery system in Washington State. Only VT cases and early-onset AF cases are included as part of TOPMed. Background The HVH study originated in 1988 with the examination of risk factors for MI. Over the ensuing years, the study has been funded by a series of grants which have added case subjects with stroke, VT, and AF. Study aims focused on the associations of medication use with cardiovascular events, and starting in 1997, the study aims expanded to include genetic associations with cardiovascular disease. Participants recruited in 2009 or later who provided blood samples for genetic analysis were asked for consent to deposit genetic and phenotypic data in dbGaP. Design As part of the HVH study, case subjects were identified by searching for ICD-9 codes consistent with MI, stroke, VT, or AF, and medical records were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis. Control subjects were identified at random from the Group Health enrollment and were matched to MI cases. All subjects have an index date. For cases, the index date was assigned as the date that the cardiovascular event (MI, stroke, VT, or AF) came to clinical attention. For controls, the index date was a random date within the range of the case index dates. For both cases and controls, information was collected from the inpatient and outpatient medical record, by telephone interview with consenting survivors, and from the Group Health pharmacy and laboratory databases. Consenting participants provided a blood specimen. Subjects Only VT and early-onset AF cases from HVH are included in TOPMed. Within the HVH study, VT and AF cases were diagnosed in both inpatient and outpatient settings, and only incident cases are eligible for inclusion in TOPMed.

The GOLDN study was initiated to assess how genetic factors interact with environmental (diet and drug) interventions to influence blood levels of triglycerides and other atherogenic lipid species and inflammation markers (registered at clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00083369). The study recruited Caucasian participants primarily from three-generational pedigrees from two NHLBI Family Heart Study (FHS) field centers (Minneapolis, MN and Salt Lake City, UT). Only families with at least two siblings were recruited and only participants who did not take lipid-lowering agents (pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals) for at least 4 weeks prior to the initial visit were included. The diet intervention followed the protocol of Patsch et al. (1992). The whipping cream (83% fat) meal had 700 Calories/m2 body surface area (2.93 mJ/m2 body surface area): 3% of calories were derived from protein (instant nonfat dry milk) and 14% from carbohydrate (sugar). The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat was 0.06 and the cholesterol content of the average meal was 240 mg. The mixture was blended with ice and flavorings. Blood samples were drawn immediately before (fasting) and at 3.5 and 6 hours after consuming the high-fat meal. The diet intervention was administered at baseline as well as after a 3-week treatment with 160 mg micronized fenofibrate. Participants were given the option to complete one or both (diet and drug) interventions. Of all participants, 1079 had phenotypic data and provided appropriate consent, and underwent whole genome sequencing through the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program.

    "Description": "\"The causal mechanisms of common diseases and their therapies have been only marginally illuminated by genetic variants identified in genome wide association studies (GWAS) utilizing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). Platelet activation pathways reflecting hemostasis and thrombosis are the underlying substrate for many cardiovascular diseases and related acute events. To overcome GWAS limitations, genomic studies are needed that integrate molecular surrogates for platelet-related phenotypes assayed in cell-based models derived from individuals of known genotypes and phenotypes. In our GWAS study of native platelet aggregation phenotypes and aggregation in response to low dose aspirin in 2200 subjects (GeneSTAR, Genetic Study of Aspirin Responsiveness), important genome wide \"\"signals\"\" (p<5x10-8) associated with native platelet aggregation and important \"\"signals\"\" associated with platelet responsiveness to aspirin were identified and replicated. Although we are currently performing functional genomics studies to elucidate our most promising findings in known genes (PEAR1, MET, PIKC3G), most \"\"signals\"\" occurred in intergenic regions or in introns. Mechanistic interpretation is limited by uncertainty as to which gene(s) are up- or down-regulated in the presence of most SNP modifications. In this 3 phase proposal, we will (1) create pluripotent stem cells (iPS) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and then differentiate these stem cells into megakaryocytes (2) develop an efficient strategy to produce iPS and megakaryocytes using a novel pooling method, and (3) produce iPS and megakaryocytes from 250 subjects in GeneSTAR (European Americans and African Americans), selected based on specific hypotheses derived from GWAS signals in native and post aspirin platelet function; characterize genetic mRNA transcripts using a comprehensive Affymetrix array; measure protein expression for transcripts of interest using mass spectrometry; examine mRNA and protein expression patterns for each GWAS signal to determine the functional pathway(s) involved in native platelet phenotypes; and examine the functional genomics of variations in responsiveness to aspirin using our prior genotyped and phenotyped population. Precise information about the exact functional processes in megakaryocytes and platelets may lead to innovative and tailored approaches to risk assessment and novel therapeutic targets to prevent first and recurrent cardiovascular and related thrombotic events.

The Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS) is a prospective cohort comprised of over 25,000 initially healthy female health professionals enrolled in the Women's Health Study, which began in 1992-1994. All participants in WGHS provided baseline blood samples and extensive survey data. Women who reported atrial fibrillation during the course of the study were asked to report diagnoses of AF at baseline, 48 months, and then annually thereafter. Participants enrolled in the continued observational follow-up who reported an incident AF event on at least one yearly questionnaire were sent an additional questionnaire to confirm the episode and to collect additional information. They were also asked for permission to review their medical records, particularly available ECGs, rhythm strips, 24-hour ECGs, and information on cardiac structure and function. For all deceased participants who reported AF during the trial and extended follow-up period, family members were contacted to obtain consent and additional relevant information. An end-point committee of physicians reviewed medical records for reported events according to predefined criteria. An incident AF event was confirmed if there was ECG evidence of AF or if a medical report clearly indicated a personal history of AF. The earliest date in the medical records when documentation was believed to have occurred was set as the date of onset of AF.

Asthma is a complex disease where the interplay between genetic factors and environmental exposures influences susceptibility and disease prognosis. Asthmatics of African descent tend to have more severe asthma and more severe clinical symptoms than individuals of European ancestry. The baseline prevalence of asthma in Barbados is high (~20%), and from admixture analyses, we have determined that the proportion of African ancestry among Barbadian founders is similar to U.S. African Americans, rendering this a unique population to disentangle the genetic basis for asthma disparities among African ancestry populations in general. We therefore performed whole genome sequencing on 1,100 individuals from the Barbados Genetics of Asthma Study (BAGS), in order to generate additional discovery of rare and structural variants that may control risk to asthma.

The San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS) is a complex pedigree-based mixed longitudinal study designed to identify low frequency or rare variants influencing susceptibility to cardiovascular disease, using whole genome sequence (WGS) information from 2,590 individuals in large Mexican American pedigrees from San Antonio, Texas. The major objectives of this study are to identify low frequency or rare variants in and around known common variant signals for CVD, as well as to find novel low frequency or rare variants influencing susceptibility to CVD. WGS of the SAFHS cohort has been obtained through three efforts. Approximately 540 WGS were performed commercially at 50X by Complete Genomics, Inc (CGI) as part of the large T2D-GENES Project. The phenotype and genotype data for this group is available at dbGaP under accession number phs000462. An additional ~900 WGS at 30X were obtained through Illumina as part of the R01HL113322 \"\"Whole Genome Sequencing to Identify Causal Genetic Variants Influencing CVD Risk\"\" project. Finally, ~1,150 WGS at 30X WGS were obtained through Illumina funded by a supplement as part of the NHLBI's TOPMed program. Extensive phenotype data are provided for sequenced individuals primarily obtained from the P01HL45522 \"\"Genetics of Atherosclerosis in Mexican Americans\"\" for adults and R01HD049051 for children in these same families. Phenotype information was collected between 1991 and 2016. For this dataset, the SAFHS appellation represents an amalgamation of the original SAFHS participants and an expansion that reexamined families previously recruited for the San Antonio Family Diabetes Study (R01DK042273) and the San Antonio Family Gall Bladder Study (R01DK053889). Due to this substantial examination history, participants may have information from up to five visits. The clinical variables reported are coordinated with TOPMed and include major adverse cardiac events (MACE), T2D status and age at diagnosis, glycemic traits (fasting glucose and insulin), blood pressure, blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, calculated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides). Additional phenotype data include the medication status at each visit, classified in four categories as any current use of diabetes, hypertension or lipid-lowering medications, and, for females, current use of female hormones. Anthropometric measurements include age, sex, height, weight, hip circumference, waist circumference and derived ratios. PBMC derived gene expression assays for a subset of ~1,060 individuals obtained using the Illumina Sentrix-6 chip is also available from the baseline examination. The WGS data have been jointly called and are available in the current TOPMed accession (phs001215).

This study aims to comprehensively interrogate the genomes of African American sarcoidosis families. Sarcoidosis is characterized by a hyperimmune response resulting in granuloma formation in multiple organs. It affects African Americans (AAs) more frequently and more severely than whites. While previous linkage, admixture, candidate gene and genome-wide association (GWA) studies show statistically compelling effects, causal variants are still unknown and much of sarcoidosis heritability is yet to be explained. This \"\"missing\"\" heritability likely includes effects of both common (minor allele frequency (MAF)>5%) and rare variants (MAF<5%), since, in AAs, the former are inadequately represented and the latter are completely unexplored by commercial genotyping arrays. These facts, coupled with the availability of next-generation sequencing compel us to perform an exhaustive search for genetic variants that form the basis of sarcoidosis. The data generated are certain to identify candidate causal variants, provide fundamental insight for functional studies and lead to important new hypotheses of inflammation resulting in new treatments in not only sarcoidosis but other inflammatory diseases as well.

GeneSTAR began in 1982 as the Johns Hopkins Sibling and Family Heart Study, a prospective longitudinal family-based study conducted originally in healthy adult siblings of people with documented early onset coronary disease under 60 years of age. Commencing in 2003, the siblings, their offspring, and the coparent of the offspring participated in a 2 week trial of aspirin 81 mg/day with pre and post ex vivo platelet function assessed using multiple agonists in whole blood and platelet rich plasma. Extensive additional cardiovascular testing and risk assessment was done at baseline and serially. Follow-up was carried out to determine incident cardiovascular disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, cancer, and related comorbidities, from 5 to 30 years after study entry. The goal of several additional phenotyping and interventional substudies has been to discover and amplify understanding of the mechanisms of atherogenic vascular diseases and attendant comorbidities.

Additional phenotype and genotype data are available for these individuals on dbGaP and can be accessed through the parent ARIC Cohort accession (phs000280). The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program is designed to generate scientific resources to enhance understanding of fundamental biological processes that underlie heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders (HLBS). It is part of a broader Precision Medicine Initiative, which aims to provide disease treatments that are tailored to an individual's unique genes and environment. TOPMed will contribute to this initiative through the integration of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and other -omics (e.g., metabolic profiles, protein and RNA expression patterns) data with molecular, behavioral, imaging, environmental, and clinical data. In doing so, this program seeks to uncover factors that increase or decrease the risk of disease, identify subtypes of disease, and develop more targeted and personalized treatments. The Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Project is part of NHLBI's TOPMed program and serves as an initial step for the larger initiative.

    "Description": "The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) is one of four networks in the NHLBI Family-Blood Pressure Program (FBPP). GENOA's long-term objective is to elucidate the genetics of target organ complications of hypertension, including both atherosclerotic and arteriolosclerotic complications involving the heart, brain, kidneys, and peripheral arteries. The longitudinal GENOA Study recruited European-American and African-American sibships with at least 2 individuals with clinically diagnosed essential hypertension before age 60 years. All other members of the sibship were invited to participate regardless of their hypertension status. Participants were diagnosed with hypertension if they had either 1) a previous clinical diagnosis of hypertension by a physician with current anti-hypertensive treatment, or 2) an average systolic blood pressure \u2265 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90 mm Hg based on the second and third readings at the time of their clinic visit. The Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP), GENOA's parent program, is an unprecedented collaboration to identify genes influencing blood pressure (BP) levels, hypertension, and its target-organ damage. This program has conducted over 21,000 physical examinations, assembled a shared database of several hundred BP and hypertension-related phenotypic measurements, completed genome-wide linkage analyses for BP, hypertension, and hypertension associated risk factors and complications, and published over 130 manuscripts on program findings. The FBPP emerged from what was initially funded as four independent networks of investigators (HyperGEN, GenNet, SAPPHIRe and GENOA) competing to identify genetic determinants of hypertension in multiple ethnic groups. Realizing the greater likelihood of success through collaboration, the investigators created a single confederation with program-wide and network-specific goals.

The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a study of the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease (disease detected non-invasively before it has produced clinical signs and symptoms) and the risk factors that predict progression to clinically overt cardiovascular disease or progression of the subclinical disease. MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent. Comprehensive phenotypic and pedigree data for MESA study participants are available through dbGaP entry phs000209. MESA Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam and determination of coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality. In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by five examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality. MESA Family The general goal of the MESA Family Study, an ancillary study to MESA funded by a grant from NHLBI, is to apply modern genetic analysis and genotyping methodologies to delineate the genetic determinants of early atherosclerosis. This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia. In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations. In a small proportion of subjects, parents of MESA index subjects participating in MESA Family were studied but only to have blood drawn for genotyping. The MESA Family cohort was recruited from the six MESA Field Centers. MESA Family participants underwent the same examination as MESA participants during May 2004 - May 2007. DNA was extracted and lymphocytes immortalized for study of candidate genes, genome-wide linkage scanning, and analyzed for linkage with these subclinical cardiovascular traits. While linkage analysis is the primary approach being used, an additional aspect of the MESA Family Study takes advantage of the existing MESA study population for testing a variety of candidate genes for association with the same subclinical traits.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by the presence of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) within circulating erythrocytes resulting in hemolytic anemia, vascular occlusion, and end organ damage due to alterations in the shape and deformability of the cell membrane. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and is most commonly caused by a single nucleotide substitution in the hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) gene located on chromosome 11. Participants in this study include children with SCD treated with hydroxyurea to pharmacologically increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and reduce disease severity. Therefore, the primary phenotype of interest in this study is the change in HbF levels in response to hydroxyurea treatment. Genetic factors have been shown to influence inter-individual variation in drug response, and identification of novel genes and variants associated with clinical outcomes in SCD will be achieved through collaboration between Baylor College of Medicine, Augusta University, Columbia University Medical Center, Emory University School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

CARDIA is a study examining the etiology and natural history of cardiovascular disease beginning in young adulthood. In 1985-1986, a cohort of 5115 healthy black and white men and women, aged 18-30 years, were selected to have approximately the same number of people in subgroups of age (18-24 and 25-30), sex, race, and education (high school or less, and more than high school) within each of four US Field Centers. These same participants were asked to participate in follow-up examinations during 1987-1988 (Year 2), 1990-1991 (Year 5), 1992-1993 (Year 7), 1995-1996 (Year 10), 2000-2001 (Year 15), 2005-2006 (Year 20), 2010-2011 (Year 25) and 2015-2016 (Year 30). In addition to the follow-up examinations, participants are contacted regularly for the ascertainment of information on out-patient procedures and hospitalizations experienced between contacts. Within the past five years, 95% of the original surviving cohort has been contacted. While the specifics of each examination have differed somewhat, data have been collected on a variety of factors believed to be related to heart disease. These include conditions with clear links to heart disease, such as blood pressure, cholesterol and other lipids. Data have also been collected on physical measurements, such as weight and skinfold fat, as well as lifestyle factors such as substance use (tobacco and alcohol), dietary and exercise patterns, behavioral and psychological variables, medical and family history, and other chemistries (e.g., insulin and glucose). In addition, subclinical atherosclerosis was measured via echocardiography during Years 5, 10, and 25, computed tomography during Years 15 and 20, and carotid ultrasound during Year 20.

The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a study of the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease (disease detected non-invasively before it has produced clinical signs and symptoms) and the risk factors that predict progression to clinically overt cardiovascular disease or progression of the subclinical disease. MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent. Comprehensive phenotypic and pedigree data for MESA study participants are available through dbGaP entry phs000209. MESA Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam and determination of coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality. In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by five examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality. MESA Family The general goal of the MESA Family Study, an ancillary study to MESA funded by a grant from NHLBI, is to apply modern genetic analysis and genotyping methodologies to delineate the genetic determinants of early atherosclerosis. This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia. In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by the presence of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) within circulating erythrocytes resulting in hemolytic anemia, vascular occlusion, and end organ damage due to alterations in the shape and deformability of the cell membrane. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and is most commonly caused by a single nucleotide substitution in the hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) gene located on chromosome 11. Participants in this study include children with SCD treated with hydroxyurea to pharmacologically increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and reduce disease severity. Therefore, the primary phenotype of interest in this study is the change in HbF levels in response to hydroxyurea treatment. Genetic factors have been shown to influence inter-individual variation in drug response, and identification of novel genes and variants associated with clinical outcomes in SCD will be achieved through collaboration between Baylor College of Medicine, Augusta University, Columbia University Medical Center, Emory University School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

The UMMS miRhythm Study is an ongoing study of adult patients undergoing an elective electrophysiology study or arrhythmia ablation procedure for a supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation (AF). Atrial fibrillation is a major clinical and public health problem that is related to atrial pathologic remodeling. Few tools are available to quantify the activity or extent of this remodeling, rendering it difficult to identify individuals at risk for AF. Previous studies have suggested an important role for miRNA in cardiovascular disease through gene expression regulation, making this a promising avenue for studying AF mechanisms. The aim of the study is to determine the time-dependent changes to key circulating miRNAs in a model of planned atrial injury and remodeling via ablation. Such knowledge might provide additional insight into the biology and activity of the acute atrial injury response, and furthermore, inform new targets for development of preventative interventions or allow for better AF risk stratification. To assess pathways regulating atrial pathological remodeling, patient blood samples are collected prior to their ablation procedures and also at a regularly scheduled 1-month follow-up appointment. Plasma expression of miRNA is measured using high-throughput quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), providing novel insights into the regulatory processes underlying AF, as well as acute atrial injury in vivo. Additionally, data collected from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is used to supplement miRNA analyses and further explore new relations between genes and abnormal heart rhythm.

Started in 2007, the Study of Asthma Phenotypes and Pharmacogenomic Interactions by Race-ethnicity (SAPPHIRE) is one of the largest asthma cohort studies in the United States. Its overarching goal is to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of asthma and asthma medication treatment response. The cohort was recruited from a large health care system serving southeast Michigan and the Detroit metropolitan area, and the participants broadly represent the demographic and socioeconomic diversity of the region. Control participants (i.e., patients without a diagnosis with asthma) were recruited from the same health system and geographic region. By virtue of their health system enrollment, both asthma case and control patients have longitudinal clinical information which was routinely collected as part of their care. Both case and control patients underwent at detailed evaluation at the time of enrollment which included lung function testing and bronchodilator response. The SAPPHIRE cohort is a member of the Asthma Translational Genomics Collaborative (ATGC). The latter was selected for whole genome sequencing in Phase 3 of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's TOPMed Program. The SAPPHIRE sample selected for sequencing includes African American and/or Latino individuals with and without asthma.

ECLIPSE was a longitudinal observational study of 2164 COPD subjects and a smaller number of smoking controls (337) and nonsmoking controls (245) followed regularly for three years, with three chest CT scans (at baseline, one year, and three years) (Vestbo et al., 2008, PMID:  18216052). Subjects were enrolled at clinical centers in the US, Canada, Europe, and New Zealand. Inclusion criteria included subjects ages 40-75, at least 10 pack-years of smoking, and spirometry in GOLD grades 2-4 (COPD cases) or normal spirometry with post-bronchodilator FEV1 >85% (predicted) and FEV1/FVC>0.7 (controls). Study visits were performed at enrollment, three months, and every six months thereafter with spirometry, questionnaires, and other clinical evaluations. The ECLIPSE CT scans have been analyzed with the VIDA software for emphysema and airway phenotypes. ECLIPSE has provided key insights into the clinical epidemiology of COPD, including COPD exacerbations (Hurst, et. al., 2010, PMID:  20843247) and lung function decline in COPD (Vestbo, et. al., 2011, PMID:  21991892). ECLIPSE has been used in a number of genetic studies of COPD susceptibility and protein biomarkers (Faner, et. al., 2014, PMID:  24310110). Genome-wide gene expression microarray data are available in 147 induced sputum samples from COPD subjects and 248 peripheral blood samples from COPD and control subjects.

Hemophilia A and B are X-linked bleeding disorders resulting from a deficiency in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), respectively. Hemophilia affects approximately 1/5000 male births worldwide, and results in premature death and disability due to bleeding if coagulation factor replacement therapy is not used effectively. Hemophilia is clinically categorized by coagulation factor activity levels and ranges in severity from mild (6% to 30%) to moderate (1-5%) to severe (<1%). Many female \"\"carriers\"\" of hemophilia also have decreased factor activity and morbidity from bleeding. Hemophilia A and B are almost always caused by identifiable mutations in the F8 and F9 genes, respectively, and these mutations are found throughout the structural genes. Although the hemophilias are monogenic disorders, there are wide variations in disease severity and therapeutic outcomes which are not readily explained by the disease causing mutations alone. The My Life Our Future (MLOF) project (www.mylifeourfuture.org) is a national resource developed by a partnership of BloodworksNW (BWNW, formerly the Puget Sound Blood Center), the American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network (ATHN), the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) and Bioverativ, to provide free F8 and F9 gene variant analysis to patients with hemophilia A or B, and to establish a research repository of DNA sequence, DNA, RNA, buffy coat, serum and plasma. The sequence analysis and serum samples are linked to a phenotypic database hosted by ATHN, with samples submitted and clinical data entered at ~100 hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) nationwide. (See ATHN Research Report Brief in the resource center at www.athn.org). MLOF has become the largest hemophilia genetic project worldwide. The roles of the MLOF partners are: BWNW, to serve as the central laboratory for the project and house the research repository; ATHN, to support and provide the administrative link with HTCs, to facilitate the collection of accurate phenotypic data, to conduct research review and approval for use of the repository and with BWNW to provide samples and data for research projects; NHF, to provide consumer education and facilitate consumer input into the project; and Bioverativ, to provide financial support and scientific input. The project is governed by a Steering Committee consisting of one representative from each organization. Subject samples chosen from the MLOF parent study for TOPMed and WGS were drawn from those who gave (or parents gave) informed consent for the Research Repository and included patients of all severities and type, but with an emphasis on those with severe hemophilia and others at increased risk of neutralizing antibody (inhibitor) formation and who had samples in the Research Repository (plasma, serum, RNA) for potential additional -omic studies. Also included were samples from subjects where a likely causative variant for hemophilia was not found in the F8 or F9 coding region, intron-exon boundaries or immediate upstream and downstream regions. Since hemophilia is an X-linked disorder, the majority of subjects are male. Racial distribution is similar to the overall population distribution.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is the primary cause of many hospital admissions, and is associated with significant secondary morbidity by increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. The incidence of AF is on the rise, and it is projected that by the year 2050 more than 10 million patients will be affected by AF in the United States alone. Anti-arrhythmic medications have limited success in maintaining sinus rhythm, are associated with side effects, and appear ineffective at reducing mortality compared to a strategy of rate control and anticoagulation. Given the significant morbidity associated with this common arrhythmia, surgical and catheter ablation techniques have been developed to treat AF. However, despite the incorporation of various strategies for ablation, long-term recurrence rates of AF remain higher than 25 percent after ablation. Current techniques for catheter ablation of AF include pulmonary vein isolation and complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) ablation. However, the contribution of each strategy to long-term procedural success and the relative importance of each strategy for different patients remain unknown. Recent advances in cardiac imaging have allowed detailed analysis of left atrial myocardial anatomy. Parallel advances in molecular genetics have identified several candidate genes involved in familial and non-familial AF. However, the pathophysiology of AF generation and maintenance, and the potential contribution of such genetic or anatomic substrates for patient selection, and for target identification during catheter ablation have not yet been examined. Advances in molecular genetics and imaging, coupled with techniques for endocardial and epicardial mapping in the electrophysiology laboratory present an opportunity to significantly improve our understanding of (1) The relation of paroxysmal versus persistent AF with (a) structural left atrial changes (left/right atrial scar, wall thinning, pulmonary vein anomalies, and coronary sinus dilation) and with (b) candidate genetic variants. (2) The relation of candidate genetic variants with (a) structural left atrial changes and with (b) electrophysiologic properties (atrial effective refractory period (AERP) inhomogeneity, voltage abnormalities, trigger burden and location, C FAE extent and location), (3) The relation of structural left atrial changes with (a) CFAE location as targets for catheter ablation and with (b) reversible conduction block/myocardial injury after pulmonary vein isolation, and (4) Individualized endocardial targets for AF ablation based on candidate genes and anatomic substrates. The proposed study will improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of AF, and may improve current techniques for treatment of this important arrhythmia.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by homozygosity for a single mutation of the beta hemoglobin gene. Despite the constancy of this genetic abnormality, the clinical course of patients with SCD is remarkably variable. SCD can affect the function and cause the failure of multiple organ systems through the pathophysiologic processes of vaso-occlusion and hemolysis. These pathophysiological processes are complex and expected to impact multiple organ systems in a variety of ways. This study, therefore, was designed to identify genetic factors that predispose SCD patients to develop specific end-organ complications and to experience more or less severe clinical courses. We enrolled > 700 patients with Hb SS, Hb S-beta0 thalassemia and HbSC being followed primarily at three southeastern U.S. regional institutions (Duke University Medical Center, University of North Carolina Medical Center, and Emory University Medical Center). Medical information obtained included the presence or absence of specific targeted outcomes (overall disease severity as well as specific types of end organ damage). Clinical data include medical status (history, physical, examination, and laboratory results) and information regarding potentially confounding environmental factors. Limited plasma samples are available for correlative studies (e.g. of cytokine levels, coagulation activation). Targeted SNP for candidate gene analysis as well as GWAS has been performed on most samples. Whole genome sequencing has been conducted through the TOPMed Consortium. The subjects in this analysis were collected as part of a larger study, \"\"Outcome Modifying Genes in Sickle Cell Disease\"\" (OMG-SCD) aimed at identifying genetic modifiers for sickle cell disease. More information about the study can be found in Elmariah et al. (2014), PMID: 24478166. Clinical and genetic data have been used to identify genetic characteristics predisposing patients with SCD to a more or less severe overall clinical course as well as to individual organ-specific complications. It is anticipated that identification of such genetic factors will reveal new therapeutic targets individualized to specific complications of SCD, leading to improved outcomes and increased life expectancy for patients with SCD.

The IPM BioMe Biobank, founded in September 2007, is an ongoing, broadly-consented electronic health record (EHR)-linked clinical care biobank that enrolls participants non-selectively from the Mount Sinai Medical Center patient population. BioMe currently comprises >42,000 participants from diverse ancestries, characterized by a broad spectrum of longitudinal biomedical traits. Participants enroll through an opt-in process and consent to be followed throughout their clinical care (past, present, and future) in real-time, allowing us to integrate their genomic information with their EHRs for discovery research and clinical care implementation. BioMe participants consent for recall, based on their genotype and/or phenotype, permitting in-depth follow-up and functional studies for selected participants at any time. Phenotypic and genomic data are stored in a secure database and made available to investigators, contingent on approval by the BioMe Governing Board. BioMe uses a \"\"data-broker\"\" system to protect confidentiality. Ancestral diversity - BioMe participants represent a broad racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity with a distinct and population-specific disease burden. Specifically, BioMe participants are of African (AA), Hispanic/Latino (HL), European (EA) and other/mixed ancestry (Table 1, Figure 1). BioMe participants are predominantly of African (AA, 24%), Hispanic/Latino (HL, 35%), European (EA, 32%), and other ancestry (OA, 10%) (Table 1, Figure 1). Participants who self-identify as Hispanic/Latino further report to be of Puerto Rican (39%), Dominican (23%), Central/South American (17%), Mexican (5%) or other Hispanic (16%) ancestry. More than 40% of European ancestry participants are genetically determined to be of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. With this broad ancestral diversity, BioMe is uniquely positioned to examine the impact of demographic and evolutionary forces that have shaped common disease risk. Phenotypes available in BioMe - BioMe has available a high-quality and validated set of fully implemented clinical phenotype data that has been culled by a multi-disciplinary team of experienced investigators, clinicians, information technologists, data-managers, and programmers who apply advanced medical informatics and data mining tools to extract and harmonize EHRs. BioMe, as a cohort, offers great versatility for designing nested case-control sample-sets, particularly for studying longitudinal traits and co-morbidity in disease burden.  ** Biomedical and clinical outcomes: The BioMe Biobank is linked to Mount Sinai's system-wide Epic EHR, which captures a full spectrum of biomedical phenotypes, including clinical outcomes, covariate and exposure data from past, present and future health care encounters. As such, the BioMe Biobank has a longitudinal design as participants consent to make all of their EHR data from past (dating back as far as 2003), present and future inpatient or outpatient encounters available for research, without restriction. The median number of outpatient encounters is 21 per participant, reflecting predominant enrollment of participants with common chronic conditions from primary care facilities. ** Environmental data: The clinical and EHR information is complemented by detailed demographic and lifestyle information, including ancestry, residence history, country of origin, personal and familial medical history, education, socio-economic status, physical activity, smoking, dietary habits, alcohol intake, and body weight history, which is collected in a systematic manner by interview-based questionnaire at time of enrollment. The IPM BioMe Biobank contributed ~10,600 DNA samples for whole genome sequencing to the TOPMed program. Samples were selected for the Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) working groups. Using a Case-Definition-Algorithm (CDA), we identified ~4,100 individuals with CAD (~50% women) and ~3,000 individuals as controls (65% women). In addition, we identified ~800 individual with COPD (62% women) and 1800 as controls (72% women). Another 600 BioMe participants with Atrial Fibrillation, all of African ancestry, were included.

CARDIA is a study examining the etiology and natural history of cardiovascular disease beginning in young adulthood. In 1985-1986, a cohort of 5115 healthy black and white men and women, aged 18-30 years, were selected to have approximately the same number of people in subgroups of age (18-24 and 25-30), sex, race, and education (high school or less, and more than high school) within each of four US Field Centers. These same participants were asked to participate in follow-up examinations during 1987-1988 (Year 2), 1990-1991 (Year 5), 1992-1993 (Year 7), 1995-1996 (Year 10), 2000-2001 (Year 15), 2005-2006 (Year 20), 2010-2011 (Year 25) and 2015-2016 (Year 30). In addition to the follow-up examinations, participants are contacted regularly for the ascertainment of information on out-patient procedures and hospitalizations experienced between contacts. Within the past five years, 95% of the original surviving cohort has been contacted. While the specifics of each examination have differed somewhat, data have been collected on a variety of factors believed to be related to heart disease. These include conditions with clear links to heart disease, such as blood pressure, cholesterol and other lipids. Data have also been collected on physical measurements, such as weight and skinfold fat, as well as lifestyle factors such as substance use (tobacco and alcohol), dietary and exercise patterns, behavioral and psychological variables, medical and family history, and other chemistries (e.g., insulin and glucose). In addition, subclinical atherosclerosis was measured via echocardiography during Years 5, 10, and 25, computed tomography during Years 15 and 20, and carotid ultrasound during Year 20.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. COPD is a heterogeneous syndrome, with affected individuals demonstrating marked differences in lung structure (emphysema vs. airway disease); physiology (airflow obstruction); and other clinical features (e.g., exacerbations, co-morbid illnesses). Multiple genomic regions influencing COPD susceptibility have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and rare coding variants can also influence risk for COPD. However, only a small percentage of the estimated heritability for COPD risk can be explained by known genetic loci. Like most complex diseases, COPD is influenced by multiple genetic determinants (each with modest individual effects). Emerging evidence supports the paradigm that complex disease genetic determinants are part of a network of interacting genes and proteins; perturbations of this network can increase disease risk. To identify this network, multiple Omics data will need to be analyzed with methods to account for nonlinear relationships and interactions between key genes and proteins. Our overall hypothesis is that integrated network analysis of genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenetic data from biospecimens ranging from lung tissue to nasal epithelial cells to blood in highly phenotyped subjects will provide insights into COPD pathogenesis and heterogeneity. We will leverage the well-phenotyped, NHLBI-funded Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) to address these questions. We will perform multi-omics analysis in 1548 lung tissue and blood samples from the LTRC. With these multi-omics data, we will utilize a systems biology approach to understand relationships between multiple genetic determinants and multiple types of Omics data. We will begin by performing single Omics analyses in COPD vs. control lung, nasal, and blood samples. Next, we will integrate single Omics data with genetic variants identified by WGS to assist in fine mapping genetic determinants of COPD. We will then perform integrated network analysis of COPD with genetic and multiple Omics data using correlation-based, gene regulatory, and Bayesian networks. Subjects were recruited from Mayo Clinic, Universities of Colorado, Michigan, and Pittsburg, and Temple University.

BADGER is a 56-week randomized, double-blind, three-treatment, three-period cross-over trial that will evaluate the differential improvement in control that is achieved following three separate treatment interventions in children whose asthma is not acceptably controlled on a low dose of ICS (per NAEPP guidelines). All participants will enter an 8-week run-in period during which time they will receive a dose of 1x ICS (fluticasone 200 \u03bcg/day). During this 8-week time period, running 2-week averages to establish the lack of acceptable asthma control will be calculated. Thus, a child could qualify for randomization at any time during this 8-week run-in period. This approach should maximize both patient safety and successful enrollment. Children will continue to receive 1x ICS during the entire treatment phase. During each period of the treatment phase, they also will receive one add-on therapy in the form of LABA, LTRA or additional 1x ICS. The order of the add-on therapy assignment will be determined by randomization into one of six treatment sequences (order determined randomly). Each treatment period will be 16 weeks in length; the initial 4 weeks of each period will be considered to be the washout period for the previous treatment. The primary outcome measures will be frequency of asthma exacerbations, asthma control days, and FEV1.

The Pediatric Cardiovascular Genetics Consortium (PCGC) proposes to define genetic causes for congenital heart defects (CHD) as part of the TOPMed Program are the most common form of heart disease in childhood and are also the most prevalent form of birth defects, occurring in 2-3% of live births. The PCGC has recruited and clinically characterized \u2265 10,000 CHD probands and parents (CHD trios). From whole exome sequencing (WES) of >2800 CHD trios, we identified a substantial enrichment of damaging de novo mutations in genes important for cardiogenesis, particularly implicating histone modifier enzyme gene defects. Analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 350 probands with CHD unexplained by WES and their parents preliminarily implicated de novo mutations in enhancers of genes previously shown to cause CHD in mouse knock out models. Sequencing of RNA (RNAseq) from discarded cardiac tissues from CHD probands has revealed likely causal allele-specific expression (ASE) as well as biallelic loss of expression (LOE). We have also discovered de novo epimutations, differentially methylated regions (DMRs), some with underlying de novo DNA variation, that are detectable in peripheral blood leukocytes and appear to underlie 10% of CHD. Of note, these assorted 'omic' approaches have enabled one another, both for attributing causality and assessing functional impact. Based on these extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that PCGC probands with uninformative exomic analyses (WES-negative) harbor de novo genetic and/or epigenetic mutations in critical regulatory elements that participate in developmental expression of cardiac genes. To identify these etiologies, we propose analyses of WGS in 1000 WES-negative CHD trios, prioritizing those with probands with banked CHD tissues (n=78), one damaging variant in a recessive CHD gene, and older fathers (age>45). We also request WGS for 230 probands, for whom we have cardiac tissues but not parental DNAs. We request RNAseq for 308 cardiac tissues. For DNA methylation, which TOPMed will offer through the Illumina 850k array platform, we are requesting analysis of DNAs from peripheral blood leukocytes for all probands for whom WGS will be performed (1000 from trios, 230 singletons) as well as DNAs from cardiac tissues (n=308) to pair with the WGS, RNAseq and blood DNA methylation data. We will use existing resources and capabilities of the PCGC to confirm relevant mutations and those of its companion consortium in the Bench to Bassinet Program, the Cardiovascular Development Consortium, to inform analyses of non-coding mutations as well as to perform confirmatory functional genomics studies using cell and animal models. We expect that the studies resulting from data generated through TOPMed will provide novel insights into the molecular basis for CHD and fundamental knowledge about genes and pathways involved in cardiac development. Aside from being relevant to CHD, we anticipate that our findings will inform the understanding of later-onset cardiovascular diseases, including some arising in adulthood.

We also request WGS for 230 probands, for whom we have cardiac tissues but not parental DNAs. We request RNAseq for 308 cardiac tissues. For DNA methylation, which TOPMed will offer through the Illumina 850k array platform, we are requesting analysis of DNAs from peripheral blood leukocytes for all probands for whom WGS will be performed (1000 from trios, 230 singletons) as well as DNAs from cardiac tissues (n=308) to pair with the WGS, RNAseq and blood DNA methylation data. We will use existing resources and capabilities of the PCGC to confirm relevant mutations and those of its companion consortium in the Bench to Bassinet Program, the Cardiovascular Development Consortium, to inform analyses of non-coding mutations as well as to perform confirmatory functional genomics studies using cell and animal models. We expect that the studies resulting from data generated through TOPMed will provide novel insights into the molecular basis for CHD and fundamental knowledge about genes and pathways involved in cardiac development. Aside from being relevant to CHD, we anticipate that our findings will inform the understanding of later-onset cardiovascular diseases, including some arising in adulthood.

    "Description": "The STOP II trial evaluated whether prophylactic transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease and high risk of stroke can be safely halted after 30 months of treatment during which patients became low risk for stroke.Stroke causes substantial morbidity in children with sickle cell disease. To prevent first strokes, the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) used prophylactic transfusions in children who were identified by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography as being at high risk for stroke. This strategy reduced the incidence of stroke among such children from 10% per year to less than 1% per year, leading to recommendations for TCD screening and prophylactic transfusion for children with abnormal velocities on ultrasonography. Despite the reduced risk of stroke, long-term use of transfusions can cause adverse side effects, such as iron overload or alloimmunization. However, cessation of transfusions is associated with recurrence of stroke, and at the time of the STOP II trial, there were no clinical or laboratory indicators to guide the duration of prophylaxis. Therefore the STOP II trial was initiated to determine whether transfusions could be limited by monitoring patients with TCD examinations after transfusions were halted and resuming transfusions if the examination indicated a high risk of stroke.The trial was halted for safety concerns after 79 of a planned 100 children were randomized. Discontinuation of transfusion for the prevention of stroke in children with sickle cell disease resulted in a high rate of reversion to abnormal blood-flow velocities on Doppler studies and stroke incidence.Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/.

    "Description": "The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease was initiated in 1977 to determine the natural history of sickle cell disease (SCD) from birth to death in order to identify those factors contributing to the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Specific objectives included: 1) to study the effect of sickle cell disease on growth and development from birth through adolescence 2) to study the conditions or events that may be related to the onset of painful crises 3) to obtain data on the nature, duration, and outcome of major complications of SCD 4) determine the nature, prevalence, and age- related incidence of organ damage due to SCD, and 5) study the role of SCD and its interaction with selected health events.Phases 2 and 3 of the study involved followup of the infant cohort. A total of 709 infants (age less than 6 months) were enrolled during Phase 1 of the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), and Phases 2 and 3 of the CSSCD was designed to follow these children for an additional 10 years. The study objectives included: 1) define prospectively the natural history of sickle cell disease; 2) determine the relationships between cognitive and academic functioning and brain status as determined by MRI; 3) determine the cognitive or behavioral markers of silent infarct; 4) determine the relationship of family functioning on the Family Environment Scale (FES) to brain status, cognitive functioning, and social and demographic factors; 5) continue studies that will enhance the state of knowledge on the influence of sickle cell disease on the psychosocial adjustment of children and adolescents. Phase 2A of the study sought to examine the progression of organ damage in the heart, lung, kidney, and liver in adult cohort patients (born before 1/1/56) enrolled in phase 1 of the study between 3/79 and 5/81. A total of 620 patients from 11 centers were eligible for phase 2A.Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/.

    "Name": "Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension and Sickle Cell Disease With Sildenafil Therapy (walk-PHaSST)",
    "Description": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive condition characterized by narrowing or stiffening pulmonary arterioles resulting in increased pulmonary blood pressure and reduced delivery of oxygenated blood to the body. It is a common complication of sickle cell disease and initially presents with the symptom of shortness of breath (dyspnea) on exertion. As the condition worsens, other symptoms such as dizziness, lower extremity edema, and chest pain can develop. The drug, sildenafil, works by relaxing blood vessels in the lungs which reduces pulmonary blood pressure and allows more oxygenated blood to circulate. Increased levels of oxygenated blood allows individuals with PAH to tolerate more activity, but guidelines for using sildenafil in patients with PAH and sickle cell disease were unavailable at the time of the Walk-PHaSST trial.Participants were screened for the existence of pulmonary hypertension with a six minute walk test and a Doppler echocardiogram that assessed TRV, diastolic function, and valvular and systolic function. Subjects with TRV \u2265 2.7 m/s received further clinical evaluation for possible causes of pulmonary hypertension. Other screening data included medical history, a physical exam, and standard laboratory testing. For individuals with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension (TRV \u2265 3.0), a cardiac catheterization was done at the baseline and week 16 data collection periods.Subjects eligible for the main intervention trial based on screening results were randomized in a 1:1 double blind fashion to receive sildenafil or placebo for 16 weeks. Subjects received 20 mg of oral sildenafil or matching placebo 3 times daily for 6 weeks, followed by 40 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks, followed by 80 mg 3 times daily for 6 weeks, as tolerated. Participants could also receive other therapies as needed to manage sickle cell and related complications. The primary outcome measure of the trial was change in the six minute walk test, a standard indicator of a person's heart and lung function and exercise capacity, from baseline to week 16. After completing the study treatment (or placebo), participants could choose to be part of the open-label follow-up phase of the study and continue to be assessed for up to one year.The study was intended to screen about 1000 subjects and randomize 132 subjects, however it was terminated early due to the unforeseen increase in adverse events in participants treated with sildenafil as compared to placebo. When the study was stopped, 33 participants had completed the trial. Subjects continued to be monitored, but were instructed to taper sildenafil treatment over three to seven days.There was no evidence that treatment with sildenafil impacted the six minute walk distance from baseline to week 16. In addition, treatment with sildenafil appeared to increase rates of hospitalization due to sickle cell disease pain.Due to in part to the early termination of the trial, the majority of subject data was collected from the screening phase of the study (n=720), as opposed to the main intervention trial (n=74).Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/.

    "Description": "The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) is a hematopoietic cell transplant registry that was established in 1972 at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The overarching goal of the registry is to study trends in transplantations and to advance the understanding and application of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for malignant and non-malignant diseases. Included in this dataset are children, adolescents and young adults with severe sickle cell disease who received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant in the United States and provided written informed consent for research.Hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease is curative. Offering this treatment for patients with severe disease is challenging as only about 20-25% of patients expected to benefit have an HLA-matched sibling. Consequently, several transplantations have utilized an HLA-matched or mismatched unrelated adult donor and HLA-mismatched relative. Transplantation strategies have also evolved over time that has included transplant conditioning regimens of varying intensity, grafts other than bone marrow and novel approaches to overcome the donor-recipient histocompatibility barrier and limit graft-versus-host disease. The data that is available for sickle cell disease transplants have been utilized to report on outcomes after transplantation and compare outcomes after transplantation of grafts HLA-matched related, HLA-mismatched related, HLA-matched and HLA-mismatched unrelated donors. Collectively, these data have advanced our knowledge and understanding of hematopoietic cell transplant for this disease. These data can also serve as 'contemporaneous controls' for comparison with other more recent curative treatments like gene therapy and gene editing.Data available for request include allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants for sickle cell disease (Hb SS and Hb S\u03b2 thalassemia) in the United States from 1991 to 2019.

The individuals sequenced here represent a small subset of the parent study (described below) and were carefully selected for the purpose of creating a Samoan-specific reference panel for imputation back into the parent study. The INFOSTIP algorithm of Gusev et. al. (2012) (PMID: 22135348) was used to optimally choose the individuals for sequencing. The research goal of the parent study (dbGaP ID phs000914) is to identify genetic variation that increases susceptibility to obesity and cardiometabolic phenotypes among adult Samoans using genome-wide association (GWAS) methods. DNA from peripheral blood and phenotypic information were collected from 3,119 adult Samoans, 23 to 70 years of age. The participants reside throughout the independent nation of Samoa, which is experiencing economic development and the nutrition transition. Genotyping was performed with the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array using a panel of approximately 900,000 SNPs. Anthropometric, fasting blood biomarkers and detailed dietary, physical activity, health and socio-demographic variables were collected. We are replicating the GWAS findings in an independent sample of 2,500 Samoans from earlier studies. After replication of genomic regions and informative SNPs in those regions, we will determine sequences of the important genes, and determine the specific genetic variants in the sequenced genes that are associated with adiposity and related cardiometabolic conditions. We will also identify gene by environment interactions, focusing on dietary intake patterns and nutrients.

Since there is a greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease among African Americans, the purpose of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is to explore the reasons for this disparity and to uncover new approaches to reduce it. The JHS is a large, community-based, observational study whose 5306 participants were recruited from among the non-institutionalized African-American adults from urban and rural areas of the three counties (Hinds, Madison, and Rankin) that make up the Jackson, MS, metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Jackson is the capital of Mississippi, the state with the largest percentage (36.3%) of African Americans in the United States. The JHS design included participants from the Jackson ARIC study who had originally been recruited through random selection from a drivers' license registry. Approximately six months before the JHS was to begin, an amendment to the federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act was passed that changed the level of consent for public release of personal information from driver's license lists from an \"\"opt out\"\" to an \"\"opt in\"\" basis. The Mississippi Highway Patrol was no longer able to release a complete listing of all persons with driver's licenses or state identification cards, which prevented its use in the JHS. New JHS participants were chosen randomly from the Accudata America commercial listing, which provides householder name, address, zip code, phone number (if available), age group in decades, and family components. The Accudata list was deemed to provide the most complete count of households for individuals aged 55 years and older in the Jackson MSA. A structured volunteer sample was also included in which demographic cells for recruitment were designed to mirror the eligible population. Enrollment was opened to volunteers who met census-derived age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES) eligibility criteria for the Jackson MSA. In addition, a family component was included in the JHS. The sampling frame for the family study was a participant in any one of the ARlC, random, or volunteer samples whose family size met eligibility requirements. Eligibility included having at least two full siblings and four first degree relatives (parents, siblings, children over the age of 21) who lived in the Jackson MSA and who were willing to participate in the study. No upper age limit was placed on the family sample. Known contact information was obtained during the baseline clinic examination from the index family member with a verbal pedigree format to identify name(s), age(s), address (es), and telephone number(s). Recruitment was limited to persons 35-84 years old except in the family cohort, where those 21 years old and above were eligible. Only persons who otherwise met study criteria but were deemed to be physically or mentally incompetent by trained recruiters were excluded from study eligibility.1  1 Wyatt SB, Diekelmann N, Henderson F, Andrew ME, Billingsley G, Felder SH et al.

Mendelian cardiovascular disorders provide crucial insights into the genetic susceptibility to more common forms of cardiovascular disease. While Mendelian cardiovascular disorders are individually rare, collectively they impose a significant public health burden. This proposal focuses on 2 specific categories of cardiovascular disease for which we have extensive research expertise and existing cohorts, congenital heart disease (CHD) and inherited arrhythmia syndromes. The tremendous burden on the health care system and on families with these Mendelian cardiovascular disorders underscore the urgency to understand their genomic bases, in order to design improved strategies for risk stratification, surveillance and medical intervention. Emerging evidence supports the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) over whole-exome sequencing (WES) for detecting coding variants in discovery projects, in addition to the obvious advantages of detecting features invisible to WES: structural variants (SV) and non-coding variants. We believe the way forward lies in widening the scope for discovery to include the patient's entire genome - and all types of variants. While family-based studies are crucial for genomic discovery, obtaining a sufficient number of high-risk pedigrees to achieve meaningful conclusions remains a challenge for most research institutions. For this proposal, we will leverage 2 powerful resources for the identification, ascertainment and recruitment of high-risk cardiovascular disease pedigrees: (1) the NHLBI-sponsored Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC) and (2) the Utah Population Database (UPDB). We propose to perform WGS on PCGC and UPDB cohorts with autosomal dominant disease to achieve the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify the genomic basis for CHD in high-risk pedigrees derived from the PCGC and UPDB; and Aim 2) Identify the genomic basis for inherited arrhythmia disorders, using extended pedigrees derived from the UPDB. Aim 2 focuses on familial forms of AF, undiagnosed Long QT Syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome and progressive conduction disorders. A WGS approach in high-risk pedigrees coupled with our validated bioinformatics pipeline, will allow the identification and prioritization of disease-causing SVs and sequence variants in coding and non-coding regulatory elements. These variants will be functionally characterized and validated in downstream experiments (heterologous expression systems, zebrafish cardiac assays, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes) that are beyond the scope of this X01. For this proposal, we have assembled the right combination of clinical expertise, resources for patient recruitment and computational know-how to enable these game-changing methodologies and to apply them to the challenge of cardiovascular Mendelian disease-gene discovery.

    "Description": "\"Sickle cell anemia is associated with substantial morbidity from acute complications and organ dysfunction beginning in the first year of life. In 1995, the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH) (dbGaP phs002348) demonstrated that, in adults, hydroxyurea is effective in decreasing the frequency of painful crises, hospitalizations for crises, acute chest syndrome, and blood transfusions by 50%. The phase I/II study of hydroxyurea in children (HUG KIDS) demonstrated that children have a response to hydroxyurea similar to that seen in adults in terms of increasing fetal hemoglobin levels and total hemoglobin, and decreasing complications associated with sickle cell anemia. In addition, this study demonstrated that the drug does not adversely affect growth and development between the ages of 5 and 15. A pilot study of hydroxyurea (HUSOFT) given to children between the ages of 6 months and 24 months demonstrated that the drug was well tolerated and that the fetal hemoglobin levels rose and remained elevated compared to baseline with continued hydroxyurea administration.A Special Emphasis Panel (SEP) met on April 12, 1996 to review the results of the MSH trial and the progress to date of the HUG KIDS study. The SEP recommended that NHLBI undertake the BABY HUG trial.The BABY HUG Randomized Controlled Trial concluded that hydroxyurea treatment in very young children seemed to have an acceptable safety profile and to reduce complications of sickle cell anemia. However, more data were needed on the long-term safety of hydroxyurea use in very young children. As a result, follow-up studies were initiated. The Follow-Up Study II provided longer follow-up than Follow-Up Study I, and included more assessment types than Follow-Up Study I.The BABY HUG program consisted of three related studies, each of which has associated datasets and bio-specimens.A randomized controlled trial comparing hydroxyurea to placebo in very young children with sickle cell anemia (BABY HUG Randomized Controlled Trial)The first observational follow-up study of children from the randomized controlled trial (BABY HUG Follow-Up Study I). All children in Follow-Up Study I were offered the option of taking open-label hydroxyurea, with treatment decisions made by the family and the clinical team caring for the child.The second observational follow-up study of children from BABY HUG Follow-Up Study I. All children in Follow-Up Study II were offered the option of taking open-label hydroxyurea, with treatment decisions made by the family and the clinical team caring for the child.The purpose of the Randomized Controlled Trial was to determine if hydroxyurea can safely prevent early end organ damage in very young children with sickle cell anemia.The purpose of the BABY HUG Follow-up Study I was to provide structured follow-up of the children enrolled in the BABY HUG Randomized Controlled Trial, in order to characterize the long-term toxicities and unexpected risks (if any) associated with treatment with hydroxyurea at an early age.The objective of Follow-Up Study II was to obtain additional data about the long-term safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea use in children with Sickle Cell Anemia through at least the first decade of life.Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/.

    "Description": "'This study is part of the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Whole Genome Sequencing Program. TOPMed is part of a broader Precision Medicine Initiative, which aims to provide disease treatments that are tailored to an individual's unique genes and environment. TOPMed will contribute to this initiative through the integration of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other -omics (e.g., metabolic profiles, protein and RNA expression patterns) data with molecular, behavioral, imaging, environmental, and clinical data. In doing so, this program aims to uncover factors that increase or decrease the risk of disease, to identify subtypes of disease, and to develop more targeted and personalized treatments. Two genotype call sets derived from WGS are now available, Freeze 8 (GRCh38) and Freeze 9b (GRCh38), with largely overlapping sample sets. Information about how to identify other TOPMed WGS accessions for cross-study analysis, as well as descriptions of TOPMed methods of data acquisition, data processing and quality control, are provided in the accompanying documents, ''TOPMed Whole Genome Sequencing Project - Freeze 8, Phases 1-4'' and ''TOPMed Whole Genome Sequencing Project - Freeze 9b, Phases 1-4''. Please check the study list at the top of each of these methods documents to determine whether it applies to this study accession.The CATHeterization GENetics (CATHGEN) biorepository collected biospecimens and clinical data on individuals age \u226518 undergoing cardiac catheterization for concern of ischemic heart disease at a single center (Duke University Medical Center) from 2000-2010; a total of N=9334 individuals were collected. Samples were matched at the individual level to clinical data collected at the time of catheterization and stored in the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Diseases (DDCD). Clinical data included subject demographics, cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiac history including symptoms, age-of-onset of cardiovascular diseases, coronary anatomy and cardiac function at catheterization, laboratory data, and yearly follow-up for hospitalizations, vital status, medication use and lifestyle factors. AF cases were defined as individuals who had ever had AF based on any ECG available at Duke University or ICD-9 code for AF used for inpatient or outpatient billing.

    "Description": "The Framingham Heart Study is a long term prospective study of the etiology of cardiovascular\ndisease among a population of free living subjects in the community of Framingham,\nMassachusetts. The Framingham Heart Study was a landmark study in epidemiology in that it\nwas the first prospective study of cardiovascular disease and identified the concept of risk\nfactors and their joint effects. The study began in 1948 and 5,209 subjects were initially enrolled\nin the study. Participants have been examined biennially since the inception of the study and all\nsubjects are continuously followed through regular surveillance for cardiovascular outcomes.\nClinic examination data has included cardiovascular disease risk factors and markers of\ndisease such as blood pressure, blood chemistry, lung function, smoking history, health\nbehaviors, ECG tracings, Echocardiography, and medication use. Through regular surveillance\nof area hospitals, participant contact, and death certificates, the Framingham Heart Study\nreviews and adjudicates events for the occurrence of Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Infarction,\nHeart Failure, and Cerebrovascular disease.\nThe enclosed dataset is a subset of the data collected as part of the Framingham study and\nincludes laboratory, clinic, questionnaire, and adjudicated event data on 4,434 participants.\nParticipant clinic data was collected during three examination periods, approximately 6 years\napart, from roughly 1956 to 1968. Each participant was followed for a total of 24 years for the\noutcome of the following events: Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Infarction, Atherothrombotic\nInfarction or Cerebral Hemorrhage (Stroke) or death. (NOTE: Although the enclosed dataset\ncontains Framingham data 'as collected' by Framingham investigators, specific methods\nwere employed to ensure an anonymous dataset that protects patient confidentiality;\ntherefore, this dataset is inappropriate for publication purposes.
